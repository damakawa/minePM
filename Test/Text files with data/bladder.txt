PMID: 27651690Title: Genital Sparing Cystectomy for Female Bladder Cancer and its Functional Outcome; a Seven Years' Experience with 24 Cases.Authors: Roshdy S, Senbel A, Khater A, Farouk O, Fathi A, Hamed E, Denewer ASource: Indian J Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep;7(3):307-311. Epub 2015 Sep 7.Abstract: The surgical treatment of bladder cancer is the curative treatment especially in early cases. In this study, our aim was to assess the outcome of preservation of internal genital organs in selected females both oncologically and functionally, and to assess the feasibility of technique and its complication. 24 females with clinically and radiologically diagnosed T2 bladder cancer underwent gynecologic-tract sparing cystectomy (GTSC). Age ranged from 45 to 60 years. Patients with diffuse carcinoma-in-situ, those with tumors involving the bladder neck, those with poor general condition and those with preoperative incontinence were excluded. 1 patient, who developed local recurrence after 6 months. One patient lost follow up after 15 months. No recurrence developed in the retained genital organs. The remaining 20 patients remained free of disease. Among women who were eligible for functional evaluation, Daytime and nighttime continence were satisfactory in 21/22 (95.4 %) and in 20/22 (90.9 %) respectively. Chronic urinary retention, pouch-vaginal fistula was not noted. Most of patients showed superior Sexual Function index. Cystectomy with preservation of the internal genital organs is feasible in female with early, solitary or T2 bladder cancer with satisfactory functional and oncologic outcomes with proper case selection.PMID: 27651643Title: The Role of Completion Surgery in Ovarian Cancer.Authors: Vinotha T, Anitha T, Ajit S, Rachel C, Abraham PSource: J Obstet Gynaecol India. 2016 Oct;66(Suppl 1):435-440. Epub 2015 Nov 4.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Patients referred with inadequately staged ovarian malignancies present a clinical dilemma. We report our experience with completion surgery in ovarian cancer. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits and risks of completion surgery in women with ovarian cancer who presented after having had inadequate primary surgery. METHODS: A retrospective case series of 30 women with ovarian cancer and one with fallopian tube cancer who had inadequate primary surgery underwent completion surgery at gynaecologic oncology unit in a tertiary level hospital in Tamil Nadu, India. Electronic medical records of patients with ovarian cancer who underwent completion surgery between January 2011 and September 2014 for ovarian were reviewed. Forty-five patients with initial inadequate surgery were identified of whom 31 underwent completion surgery; the remaining 14 did not return to our hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-one women with a mean age of 37 years (17-53) and median parity of 2 (0-4) with inadequately staged ovarian malignancy underwent completion surgery. Complex ovarian mass was the most common indication for initial surgery (94 %). The tumours were epithelial in 27 (87 %), germ cell in 3 (10 %) and sex cord stromal in 1 (3 %). In view of extensive disease at presentation, 19 % (6/31) were referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent interval debulking. With regard to surgical complexity, 52 % (16/31), 38 % (12/31) and 10 % (3/31) underwent simple, intermediate and complex surgeries, respectively. Optimal cytoreduction (R0 and R1) was performed in 25 patients (81 %). Twelve (39 %) had upstaging of disease. Six patients required no further adjuvant treatment following surgical restaging. Complications included bladder injury (1), iliac vessel injury (1) and surgical site infections (2). During the study period of 45 months, 7 patients (23 %) presented with disease recurrence. There were 2 recorded deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In inadequately staged ovarian malignancies, completion surgery should be considered based on the patients' performance status and disease assessment. Considering the low specificity of imaging and Ca 125, completion surgery provides information to plan adjuvant therapy, besides allowing optimal cytoreduction but delays initiation of adjuvant therapy.PMID: 27651567Title: Analysis of dose distribution in organs at risk in patients with prostate cancer treated with the intensity-modulated radiation therapy and arc technique.Authors: Biegala M, Hydzik ASource: J Med Phys. 2016 Jul-Sep;41(3):198-204.Abstract: This study describes a comparative analysis of treatment plans in 48 patients with prostate cancer treated with ionizing radiation. Each patient was subjected to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and arc technique. In each treatment plan, the organs at risk were assessed: the urinary bladder, rectum and heads of the femur, as well as the volume of normal tissue. The following features were compared: treatment time, conformity indices for the planning target volume, mean doses and standard deviation in organs at risk, and organ volumes for each particular dose. The treatment period in the arc technique is 13.7% shorter than in the IMRT technique. Comparing the results of the IMRT and arc techniques (arc vs. IMRT), the mean values were 29.21 +/- 12.91 Gy versus 28.36 +/- 13.79 Gy for the bladder, 20.36 +/- 3.16 Gy versus 18.17 +/- 5.11 Gy for the right femoral head, and 18.98 +/- 3.28 Gy versus 16.67 +/- 5.15 Gy for the left femoral head. For the rectum, lower values were obtained after application of the arc technique, not the IMRT technique: 35.84 +/- 12.28 Gy versus 35.90 +/- 13.05 Gy. The results indicate that the applied therapy has a statistically significant influence on the volume for a particular dose with regard to the urinary bladder. It is advisable to apply the IMRT technique to patients who need the femur heads and urinary bladder protected by exposing them to low irradiation doses.PMID: 27651562Title: Dosimetric and radiobiological characterizations of prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy: A single-institution review of ninety cases.Authors: Khan MI, Jiang R, Kiciak A, Ur Rehman J, Afzal M, Chow JCSource: J Med Phys. 2016 Jul-Sep;41(3):162-168.Abstract: This study reviewed prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans after prostate IMRT technique was replaced by VMAT in an institution. Characterizations of dosimetry and radiobiological variation in prostate were determined based on treatment plans of 40 prostate IMRT patients (planning target volume = 77.8-335 cm3) and 50 VMAT patients (planning target volume = 120-351 cm3) treated before and after 2013, respectively. Both IMRT and VMAT plans used the same dose-volume criteria in the inverse planning optimization. Dose-volume histogram, mean doses of target and normal tissues (rectum, bladder and femoral heads), dose-volume points (D99% of planning target volume; D30%, D50%, V30 Gy and V35 Gy of rectum and bladder; D5%, V14 Gy, V22 Gy of femoral heads), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), prostate tumor control probability (TCP), and rectal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) based on the Lyman-Burman-Kutcher algorithm were calculated for each IMRT and VMAT plan. From our results, VMAT plan was found better due to its higher (1.05%) CI, lower (0.83%) HI and (0.75%) GI than IMRT. Comparing doses in normal tissues between IMRT and VMAT, it was found that IMRT mostly delivered higher doses of about 1.05% to the normal tissues than VMAT. Prostate TCP and rectal NTCP were found increased (1%) for VMAT than IMRT. It is seen that VMAT technique can decrease the dose-volume evaluation criteria for the normal tissues. Based on our dosimetric and radiobiological results in treatment plans, it is concluded that our VMAT implementation could produce comparable or slightly better target coverage and normal tissue sparing with a faster treatment time in prostate radiotherapy.PMID: 27649287Title: Ephrin-B2 overexpression predicts for poor prognosis and response to therapy in solid tumors.Authors: Oweida A, Bhatia S, Hirsch K, Calame D, Griego A, Keysar S, Pitts T, Sharma J, Eckhardt G, Jimeno A, Wang XJ, Parkash G, Califano J, Karam SSource: Mol Carcinog. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/mc.22574.Abstract: Ephrin B2 is variably expressed on tumor cells and its blockade has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in animal models of pancreatic, colorectal, lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. However, the implications of ephrinB2 expression in cancer patients have remained elusive. In this study, we analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) for ephrinB2 expression. We report significant correlations between EFNB2 expression, overall survival and disease-free survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC, n = 519), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 186) and bladder urothelial carcinoma (n = 410). In HNSCC patients, high EFNB2 mRNA expression was associated with tumor HPV negativity, oral cavity location, alcohol intake, higher TP53 mutation, and EGFR amplification. EphrinB2 overexpression also correlated with worse response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The therapeutic potential of blocking ephrinB2 was validated in HNSCC patient-derived tumor xenografts and showed significant improvement in survival and tumor growth delay. Our data shows that ephrinB2 overexpression can serve as a critical biomarker for patient prognosis and response to therapy. These results should guide design of future clinical trials exploring EphrinB2 inhibition in cancer patients. This article is protected by copyright.

In Brazil, this approach has not yet been pre notviously reported. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to describe Step-by-Step the Retzus-sparing RARP surgical technique and report our first Brazilian experience. METHODS: We present a case of a 60-year-old white man with low risk prostate cancer. Surgical materials were four arms Da Vinci robotic platform system, six transperitoneal portals, two prolene wires and Polymer Clips. This surgical tech notnique was step-by-step described according to Galfano et al. One additional step was added as a modification of Galfano et al. Primary technique description: The closure of the Denovellier fascia. RESULTS: We have operated one patient with this technique. The operative time was 180minutes, console time was135 min, the blood loss was 150ml, none perioperative or postoperative complications was found, hospital stay of 01 day. The anatomopathological classification revealed a pT2aN0M0 specimen with free surgical margins. The patient achieved continence immediately after bladder stent retrieval. Full erection reported after 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSION: Retzus-sparing RARP approach is feasible and reproducible. However, further comparative studies are neces notsary to demonstrate potential benefits in continence and sexual outcomes over the standard approaches.PMID: 27648356Title: miR-186 inhibits cell proliferation of prostate cancer by targeting GOLPH3.Authors: Hua X, Xiao Y, Pan W, Li M, Huang X, Liao Z, Xian Q, Yu LSource: Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 1;6(8):1650-60. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among men, many miRNAs have been demonstrated to play critical role in the progression of prostate cancer, miR-186 suppresses the progression of many tumors, such as bladder cancer and glioma. Previous study shows miR-186 is downregulated in prostate cancer tissues, and is a good prognosis for prostate cancer patients. In this study, we found miR-186 was downregulated in prostate cancer cells and tissues, overexpression of miR-186 inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro determined by MTT assay, colony formation assay and soft agar growth assay, whereas knockdown of miR-186 reduced these effects. Cell cycle analysis found miR-186 overexpression arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, and reduced p21 and p27 levels, and enhanced Cyclin D1 and the phosphorylation of Rb levels, suggesting miR-186 blocked G1/S transition. A novel oncogene Golgi phhosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) was the target of miR-186, miR-186 bound to the 3'UTR of GOLPH3. Moreover, miR-186 was negatively correlated with GOLPH3 in prostate cancer tissues. In conclusion, our study suggested miR-186 inhibited cell proliferation through targeting oncogene GOLPH3.PMID: 27648338Title: Skeletal Muscle Metastases to the Flexor Digitorum Superficialis and Profundus from Urothelial Cell Carcinoma and Review of the Literature.Authors: Guidi M, Fusetti C, Lucchina SSource: Case Rep Urol. 2016;2016:2387501. doi: 10.1155/2016/2387501. Epub 2016 Aug 28.Abstract: Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) metastases to skeletal muscle are extremely rare and usually found in patients with advanced stage cancer. The most common sites of bladder cancer metastases are lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bones. Muscle is an unusual site of metastases from a distant primary cancer, due to several protective factors. We present a rare case of 76-year-old patient with metastases in the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscles, 2 years after a radical cystectomy for invasive UCC of the bladder. This case is the first description of a forearm lesion, with an extensive infiltration of the volar compartments of the forearm, and the first one with a clear functional impairment.PMID: 27648282Title: Use of a prospective cohort study in the development of a bladder scanning protocol to assist in bladder filling consistency for prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.Authors: Cramp L, Connors V, Wood M, Westhuyzen J, McKay M, Greenham SSource: J Med Radiat Sci. 2016 Sep;63(3):179-85. doi: 10.1002/jmrs.162. Epub 2016 Feb 23.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Evidence of variations in bladder filling effecting prostate stability and therefore treatment and side-effects is well established with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This study aimed to increase bladder volume reproducibility for prostate radiation therapy by implementing a bladder scanning (BS) protocol that could assist patients' bladder filling at computed tomography (CT) simulation and treatment. METHODS: Based on a retrospective review of 524 prostate cancer patients, a bladder volume of 250-350 mL was adopted as 'ideal' for achieving planning dose constraints. A prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the clinical utility of measuring patients' bladder volumes at CT simulation using an ultrasound bladder scanner (Verathon 9400 BladderScan((R))). A revised bladder preparation protocol was utilised by a bladder scan group (BS) and a non-BS group followed the standard departmental bladder preparation protocol. Time and volume data for the BS group (n = 17) were compared with the non-BS group (n = 17). RESULTS: The BS cohort had a CT bladder volume range of 221-588 mL; mean 379 mL, SD 125 mL. The non-BS group had a larger range: 184-757 mL; mean 373 mL, SD 160 mL (P = 0.9171). There was a positive correlation between CT volume and BS volume in the BS group (r = 0.797; P = 0.0002) although BS volumes were smaller: range 160-420 mL; mean 251 mL; SD 91 mL; P < 0.0001). The maximum bladder volume receiving 50 Gy (V50) from the BS group was 46.4%, mean 24.5%. The maximum bladder V50 from the non-BS group was 50.9%, mean 27.3% (P = 0.5178). Treatment data from weekly cone beam CT scans were also compared over 6 weeks. They were assessed as being a pass if bladder and bowel requirements were acceptable. The BS group proceeded to treatment on the basis of a pass 92.7% of the time, whereas the pass rate for non-BS group was 75%; difference 17.7% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The BS is a useful tool for achieving consistent, appropriately sized bladder volumes in prostate cancer patients.PMID: 27647675Title: An unexpected surge in plasma BKPyV viral load heralds the development of BKPyV associated metastatic bladder cancer in a lung transplant recipient with BKPyV nephropathy.Authors: Kuppachi S, Holanda D, Eberlein M, Alexiev B, Tyler AJ, Wissel MC, Kleiboeker SB, Thomas CPSource: Am J Transplant. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1111/ajt.14057.Abstract: We report a lung transplant recipient who developed BK polyoma virus (BKPyV) DNAemia and BKPyV nephropathy. With careful management of his immunosuppression he achieved significant reduction in BKPyV DNAemia and stabilization of his kidney function. He later developed a high-grade bladder cancer and shortly thereafter he experienced a major upsurge in the level of BKPyV DNAemia that coincided with the discovery of hepatic metastasis. Retrospectively, the bladder cancer and the hepatic secondary tumor stained uniformly for SV40 large T antigen (SV40 LTAg), and the BKPyV DNA sequences identified in plasma corresponded to BKPyV DNA within hepatic tissue indicating that the spike in BKPyV load was likely derived from the circulating tumor cells or cell free tumor DNA following metastases of a BKV-associated cancer. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of a surge in BKPyV load in a patient with controlled BKPyVN that heralded the appearance of a metastatic urothelial malignancy. This report discusses the literature on BKPyV-associated malignancies and the possibility that unexplained increases in BKPyV DNAemia may be a biomarker for metastatic BKPyV-related urothelial cancer.

However, often resulting deformations are not satisfying, since varying deformation properties of different anatomical regions are not considered. To improve the plausibility of DIR in adaptive radiotherapy in the male pelvic area, this work integrates a local rigidity deformation model into a DIR algorithm. METHODS: A DIR framework is extended by constraints, enforcing locally rigid deformation behavior for arbitrary delineated structures. The approach restricts those structures to rigid deformations, while surrounding tissue is still allowed to deform elastically. The algorithm is tested on ten CT/CBCT male pelvis datasets with active rigidity constraints on bones and prostate and compared to the Varian SmartAdapt deformable registration (VSA) on delineations of bladder, prostate and bones. RESULTS: The approach with no rigid structures (REG0) obtains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.87 +/- 0.06 and a Hausdorff-Distance (HD) of 8.74 +/- 5.95 mm. The new approach with rigid bones (REG1) yields a DSC of 0.87 +/- 0.07, HD 8.91 +/- 5.89 mm. Rigid deformation of bones and prostate (REG2) obtains 0.87 +/- 0.06, HD 8.73 +/- 6.01 mm, while VSA yields a DSC of 0.86 +/- 0.07, HD 10.22 +/- 6.62 mm. No deformation grid foldings are observed for REG0 and REG1 in 7 of 10 cases; for REG2 in 8 of 10 cases, with no grid foldings in prostate, an average of 0.08 % in bladder (REG2: no foldings) and 0.01 % inside the body contour. VSA exhibits grid foldings in each case, with an average percentage of 1.81 % for prostate, 1.74 % for bladder and 0.12 % for the body contour. While REG1 and REG2 keep bones rigid, elastic bone deformations are observed with REG0 and VSA. An average runtime of 26.2 s was achieved with REG1; 31.1 s with REG2, compared to 10.5 s with REG0 and 10.7 s with VMS. CONCLUSIONS: With accuracy in the range of VSA, the new approach with constraints delivers physically more plausible deformations in the pelvic area with guaranteed rigidity of arbitrary structures. Although the algorithm uses an advanced deformation model, clinically feasible runtimes are achieved.PMID: 27647081Title: Mitomycin C: new strategies to improve efficacy of a well-known therapy.Authors: Ragonese M, Racioppi M, Bassi PF, Di Gianfrancesco L, Lenci N, Filianoti A, Recupero SMSource: Urologia. 2016 Sep 17:0. doi: 10.5301/uro.5000193.Abstract: Mitomycin C (MMC) as an intravesical chemotherapeutic agent is a well-known option for treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) recurrence; it is probably the most commonly used agent given its low rate of side effects and its efficacy.Both the American Urologic Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) consider MMC as a standard treatment for immediate single-dose postoperative treatment and for adjuvant therapy in low and intermediate-risk NMIBC.Despite the popularity of this agent in the treatment of NMIBCs, many questions regarding the optimal approach to MMC therapy remain unanswered and the schedule widely used is empirical.Nevertheless, even when the current optimal approaches to MMC administration are used, a large proportion of NMIBCs recur.This apparent treatment resistance might be overcome by an optimization of standard MMC therapy or with a combination of MMC with other agents that have different mechanisms of action.Strategies to enhance passive delivery of MMC have been well studied and multiple measures are recommended for implementation of use in routine clinical practice.A modified scheme of instillation seems to be an easy and inexpensive alternative to increase efficacy of intravesical MMC and to also use this agent with an ablative intent.Enhancing tumor response with a sequential therapy is another option that has been investigated, mostly for chemo-immunotherapy wherein the different mechanisms of action of Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) and MMC are combined to achieve a higher response.PMID: 27646875Title: Prognostic significance of markers of systemic inflammatory response in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Mbeutcha A, Shariat SF, Rieken M, Rink M, Xylinas E, Seitz C, Lucca I, Mathieu R, Roupret M, Briganti A, Karakiewicz PI, Klatte TSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 16. pii: S1078-1439(16)30065-5. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.05.013.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) are markers of systemic inflammatory response, which have been associated with the prognosis of multiple malignancies, but their relationships with oncologic outcomes of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have not been well studied yet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,117 patients with NMIBC who underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder. Univariable and multivariable competing risk regression models were used to assess the association of preoperative NLR and CRP with disease recurrence and progression to muscle-invasive disease. The median follow-up was 64 months. RESULTS: In total, 360 patients (32.2%) had a high NLR (>/=2.5) and 145 (13.0%) had a high CRP (>/=5mg/l). On multivariable analyses, a high NLR was associated with both disease recurrence (subhazard ratio [SHR] = 1.27, P = 0.013) and progression (SHR = 1.72, P = 0.007), and high CRP was associated with disease progression (SHR = 1.72, P = 0.031). Adding NLR and CRP to the multivariable model predicting disease progression lead to a relevant change in discrimination (+2.0%). In a subgroup analysis of 300 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin, both high NLR and high CRP were associated with disease progression (SHR = 2.80, P = 0.026 and SHR = 3.51, P = 0.021, respectively), and NLR was associated with disease recurrence (SHR = 1.46, P = 0.046). There was also an increase in the discrimination of the model predicting progression after bacillus Calmette-Guerin following the inclusion of both markers (+2.4%). CONCLUSION: In patients with NMIBC, markers of systemic inflammation response are associated with disease recurrence and progression. The inclusion of such markers in prognostic models does enhance their accuracy.PMID: 27646812Title: Evidence of a clinically significant interaction between warfarin and intravesical gemcitabine.Authors: Kurtzhalts K, Gee ME, Feuz L, Krajewski KCSource: Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2016 Oct 1;73(19):1508-11. doi: 10.2146/ajhp150425.Abstract: PURPOSE: A case of supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) values and hematomas subsequent to concomitant administration of warfarin and intravesical gemcitabine is reported. SUMMARY: A 90-year-old man with bladder cancer refractory to bacillius Calmette-Guerin was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and started on warfarin one month before starting treatment with intravesical gemcitabine 2 g (one dose per week for six weeks). Before intravesical gemcitabine was started, the patient reached consecutive therapeutic INR values. During the first five cycles of intravesical gemcitabine, the patient began to experience critically elevated INRs, which resulted in hospitalization and led to the discovery of hematomas. At hospital discharge, the decision was made to discontinue warfarin permanently given the patient's history of critically elevated INRs. Instead, enoxaparin was initiated due to the patient's history of DVT and active malignancy. Enoxaparin was started at a therapeutic, renally adjusted dosage of 60 mg subcutaneously once daily after the patient's hematomas resolved and hemoglobin level stabilized. The patient was cleared for discharge to his home after 17 days of hospitalization. He was scheduled to follow up with both urology and hematology departments regarding any further treatment for bladder cancer. A week after discharge, the patient's family decided that he would not receive the last (sixth) cycle of intravesical gemcitabine. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an interaction between intravesical gemcitabine and warfarin. CONCLUSION: A 90-year-old man on a stable dose of warfarin experienced an increase in INR values after receiving intravesical gemcitabine for the treatment of bladder cancer.PMID: 27644620Title: Chronic Infections of the Urinary Tract and Bladder Cancer Risk: a Systematic Review.Authors: Anderson-Otunu O, Akhtar SSource: Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):3805-7.Abstract: Literature on the relationship between recurrent urinary tract infections and urinary bladder carcinoma risk has been inconsistent. Therefore, we carried out this systematic review of observational studies to ascertain if there is any association between chronic urinary tract infection and urinary bladder carcinoma. A total of 10 databases were searched using Boolean: CINAHL, PUBMED, Google Scholar, Medline, Science Direct, SCIRUS, Cochrane, UK PubMed central, NHS evidence and WHO-website. The search yielded an initial hit of 3,518 articles and after screening and critical appraisal, seven studies were included for this review. Four articles reported an association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer while three concluded a weak or no association at least in one gender. Main findings in this review were that most of the studies reported an association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk. However, inferences about the causal association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk should be drawn cautiously considering the methodological limitations of case-control studies included in this review. Therefore, more empirical evidence is needed to determine the causal nature of relationships between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk.PMID: 27644609Title: Lack of Any Role of Systemic Inflammatory Responses in Predicting Muscle Invasion by Bladder Cancer.Authors: Solakhan M, Demirpence O, Orhan N, Yildirim OA, Guzel E, Yildirim MSource: Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):3737-9.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is a relation between platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values and tumour histology and spread in bladder cancer cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder cancer patients undergoing TUR-M operation, with histopathologically verified diagnosis, followed-up and treated at the Private Medical Park Gaziantep Hospital between 2010 and 2015, were included in the study. NLR and PLR values were calculated using complete blood count data obtained at the first presentation. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the study, 7 (7.1%) women and 92 men (92.9%). When NLR was used as the indicator of systemic inflammatory response (SIR), it was determined that 52 (52.5%) of the patients were SIR negative and 47 (47.5%) SIR positive. No significant relation could be detected between NLR and tumour grade and muscle invasion (p=0.948, p=0.480). When PLR was used as SIR indicator, it was determined that 71 (71.7%) of the patients were found as negative and 28 (28.3%) as positive. No significant relation could be detected between PLR and tumour grade and muscle invasion (p=0.651, p=0.494). CONCLUSIONS: In our study we did not detected a relation between tumour histological behavior and PLR and NLR in bladder cancer. However, NLR and PLR are easily calculated, accessible, inexpensive and simple-to-use laboratory data from whole blood counts.PMID: 27644257Title: Downregulation of Pigment epithelium-derived factor is associated with increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bladder cancer.Authors: Dong BB, Yan JS, Yan YY, Xie TC, Xu L, Hu GH, Xu YF, Liu MSource: Panminerva Med. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis in bladder cancer, but whether it modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unknown. METHODS: We have included 68 samples of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in this study. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all sample sections for expressions of PEDF, SNAI2, Vimentin and E-cadherin, which were quantified and The EMT index (EMTi) was calculated by Vimentin/E-cadherin. Levels of expression were studied for correlations with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Patients were grouped with high (EMTi <= 1) and low (EMTi > 1) EMT level for comparisons of clinicopathological parameters. In the univariate analysis, EMT level was shown to be significantly associated with tumour onset and PEDF level, but not with gender, occurrence, stage, grade, or SNAI2 level. Further multivariate analysis revealed that PEDF level was significantly negatively correlated with EMTi independent of other clinicopathological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PEDF may serve as a promising novel modality for the treatment of bladder cancer, as it can inhibit not only angiogenesis but also EMT process of bladder cancer.PMID: 27643540Title: Association of germline variants in the APOBEC3 region with cancer risk and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in tumors.Authors: Middlebrooks CD, Banday AR, Matsuda K, Udquim KI, Onabajo OO, Paquin A, Figueroa JD, Zhu B, Koutros S, Kubo M, Shuin T, Freedman ND, Kogevinas M, Malats N, Chanock SJ, Garcia-Closas M, Silverman DT, Rothman N, Prokunina-Olsson LSource: Nat Genet. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/ng.3670.Abstract: High rates of APOBEC-signature mutations are found in many tumors, but factors affecting this mutation pattern are not well understood. Here we explored the contribution of two common germline variants in the APOBEC3 region. SNP rs1014971 was associated with bladder cancer risk, increased APOBEC3B expression, and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in bladder tumors. In contrast, a 30-kb deletion that eliminates APOBEC3B and creates an APOBEC3A-APOBEC3B chimera was not important in bladder cancer, whereas it was associated with breast cancer risk and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in breast tumors. In vitro, APOBEC3B expression was predominantly induced by treatment with a DNA-damaging drug in bladder cancer cell lines, and APOBEC3A expression was induced as part of the antiviral interferon-stimulated response in breast cancer cell lines. These findings suggest a tissue-specific role of environmental oncogenic triggers, particularly in individuals with germline APOBEC3 risk variants.PMID: 27641313Title: Microhematuria assessment an IBCN consensus-Based upon a critical review of current guidelines.Authors: Schmitz-Drager BJ, Kuckuck EC, Zuiverloon TC, Zwarthoff EC, Saltzman A, Srivastava A, Hudson MA, Seiler R, Todenhofer T, Vlahou A, Grossman HB, Schoenberg MP, Sanchez-Carbayo M, Brunn LA, van Rhijn BW, Goebell PJ, Kamat AM, Roupret M, Shariat SF, Kiemeney LASource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S1078-1439(16)30111-9. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.05.030.Abstract: RATIONALE: Assessment of patients with asymptomatic microhematuria (aMh) has been a challenge to urologists for decades. The aMh is a condition with a high prevalence in the general population and also an established diagnostic indicator of bladder cancer. Acknowledging aMh needs to be assessed within a complex context, multiple guidelines have been developed to identify individuals at high risk of being diagnosed with bladder cancer. MATERIAL & METHODS: This structured review and consensus of the International Bladder Cancer Network (IBCN) identified and examined 9 major guidelines. These recommendations are partly based on findings from a long-term study on the effects of home dipstick testing, but also on the assumption that early detection of malignancy might be beneficial. RESULTS: Despite similar designs, these guidelines differ in a variety of parameters including definition of aMh, rating of risks, use of imaging modalities, and the role of urine cytology. In addition, recommendations for further follow-up after negative initial assessment are controversial. In this review, different aspects for aMh assessment are analyzed based upon the evidence currently available. DISCUSSION: We question whether adherence to the complicated algorithms as recommended by most guidelines is practical for routine use. Based upon a consensus, the authors postulate a need for better tools. New concepts for risk assessment permitting improved risk stratification and prepone cystoscopy before refined imaging procedures (computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging) are suggested.PMID: 27640312Title: Disulfide-crosslinked nanomicelles confer cancer-specific drug delivery and improve efficacy of paclitaxel in bladder cancer.Authors: Pan A, Zhang H, Li Y, Lin TY, Wang F, Lee J, Cheng M, Dall'Era M, Li T, deVere White R, Pan CX, Lam KSSource: Nanotechnology. 2016 Oct 21;27(42):425103. doi: 10.1088/0957-4484/27/42/425103. Epub 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Chemotherapy commonly used in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer is only moderately effective and associated with significant toxicity. There has been no appreciable improvement in overall survival over the last three decades. The goal of this project is to develop and characterize bladder cancer-specific nanometer-scale micelles loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) and determine the anti-tumor activity and toxicity. Micelle-building-material telodendrimers were synthesized through the stepwise conjugation of eight cholic acid units at one terminus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a bladder cancer-specific targeting peptide named PLZ4 at the other terminus. To synthesize disulfide-crosslinked PLZ4 nanomicelles (DC-PNM), cysteine was introduced between the cholic acid and PEG. DC-PNM-PTX was synthesized through the evaporation method by loading PTX in the core. The loading capacity of PTX in DC-PNM was 25% (W/W). The loading efficiency was over 99%. DC-PNM-PTX was spherical with the median size of 25 nm. The stability of DC-PNM-PTX was determined in a solution containing sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS). It was stable in a SDS solution, but dissolved within 5 min after the addition of glutathione at the physiological intracellular concentration of 10 mM. In vivo targeting and anti-tumor activity were determined in immunodeficient mice carrying patient-derived bladder cancer xenografts (PDXs). After intravenous administration, DC-PNM specifically targeted the bladder cancer PDXs, but very little to the lung cancer xenografts in the same mice (p < 0.001). DC-PNM loaded with PTX overcame cisplatin resistance, and improved the median survival from 55 d with free PTX to 69.5 d (p = 0.03) of mice carrying PDXs. In conclusion, DC-PNM remained stable in the SDS solution, specifically targeted the bladder cancer xenografts in vivo, and improved the anti-cancer efficacy of PTX.PMID: 27639777Title: Pathologic response in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Is therapeutic effect owing to chemotherapy or TURBT?Authors: Brant A, Kates M, Chappidi MR, Patel HD, Sopko NA, Netto GJ, Baras AS, Hahn NM, Pierorazio PM, Bivalacqua TJSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S1078-1439(16)30214-9. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.08.005.Abstract: PURPOSE: We estimated the proportion of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer whose tumors were downstaged by transurethral resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients with cT2 N0 urothelial carcinoma who underwent cystectomy at our institution from 2005 to 2014-overall, 139 underwent transurethral resection without chemotherapy, and 146 underwent transurethral resection with chemotherapy. Pathologic response was defined as<pT2 N0. We used a Poisson regression model to determine relative risk (RR) of pathologic response in nonneoadjuvant vs. neoadjuvant patients, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. This RR was used to estimate the response attributable to transurethral resection. RESULTS: Neoadjuvant patients were younger than nonneoadjuvant patients (64.4 vs. 71.4 years, P<0.01), with higher median body mass index (28.4 vs. 26.6kg/m2, P<0.01), lower prevalence of Charlson score>/=3 (13.7% vs. 30.2%, P<0.01), and lower prevalence of prior non-muscle-invasive cancer (7.5% vs. 20.9%, P<0.01). More neoadjuvant patients achieved response compared with nonneoadjuvant patients (62.3% vs. 20.1%, RR = 3.10, P<0.01). Adjustment resulted in a RR of pathologic response in neoadjuvant vs. nonneoadjuvant patients of 2.60 (95% CI: 1.81-3.74, P<0.01). This adjusted RR indicates that among patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo transurethral resection, 38% (95% CI: 27%-55%) of pathologic response can be attributed to transurethral resection. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that in a cohort of patients who receive chemotherapy and undergo transurethral resection before cystectomy, 38% of pathologic response can be attributed to transurethral resection. Understanding who responds to chemotherapy and who responds to transurethral resection is needed to measure the effectiveness of both interventions.PMID: 27639776Title: The efficacy of BCG TICE and BCG Connaught in a cohort of 2,099 patients with T1G3 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Witjes JA, Dalbagni G, Karnes RJ, Shariat S, Joniau S, Palou J, Serretta V, Larre S, di Stasi S, Colombo R, Babjuk M, Malmstrom PU, Malats N, Irani J, Baniel J, Cai T, Cha E, Ardelt P, Varkarakis J, Bartoletti R, Spahn M, Pisano F, Gontero P, Sylvester RSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S1078-1439(16)30114-4. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.05.033.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Potential differences in efficacy of different bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) strains are of importance for daily practice, especially in the era of BCG shortage. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively compare the outcome with BCG Connaught and BCG TICE in a large study cohort of pT1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual patient data were collected for 2,451 patients with primary T1G3 tumors from 23 centers who were treated with BCG for the first time between 1990 and 2011. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Using Cox multivariable regression and adjusting for the most important prognostic factors in this nonrandomized comparison, BCG Connaught and TICE were compared for time to recurrence, progression, and the duration of cancer specific survival and overall survival. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Information on the BCG strain was available for 2,099 patients: 957 on Connaught and 1,142 on TICE. Overall, 765 (36%) patients received some form of maintenance BCG, 560 (59%) on Connaught and 205 (18%) on TICE. Without maintenance, Connaught was more effective than TICE only for the time to first recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.20-1.82; P<0.001). With maintenance, TICE was more effective than Connaught for the time to first recurrence (HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47-0.93; P = 0.019) with a trend for cancer specific survival (HR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.92; P = 0.033). For time to progression and overall survival, Connaught and TICE had a similar efficacy. Compared to no maintenance therapy, maintenance BCG significantly reduced the risk of recurrence, progression and death, both overall, and disease specific, for TICE, but not for Connaught. CONCLUSIONS: We found that BCG Connaught results in a lower recurrence rate as compared with BCG TICE when no maintenance is used. However, the opposite is true when maintenance is given. PATIENT SUMMARY: As there is currently a BCG shortage, information on the efficacy of different BCG strains is important. In this nonrandomized retrospective comparison in over 2,000 patients, we found that BCG Connaught reduces the recurrence rate compared to BCG TICE when no maintenance is used, but the opposite is true when maintenance is given.PMID: 27639725Title: Feasibility and safety study for the use of wound protectors during robotic radical cystectomy and ileal conduit.Authors: Huynh D, Henderson A, Haden T, Jones A, Pokala NSource: J Robot Surg. 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RALRC) is increasingly being performed for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. There is increased tension while performing the ureteroileal anastomosis through a small incision. Patients are at risk to suffer wound and skin complications perioperatively due to possible contamination with bowel contents. The Alexis(R) retractor helps with retraction of small incisions potentially reducing tension and also reduces wound infection rates as reported in the colorectal literature. This pilot study evaluates the use of the Alexis(R) wound protector (WP) in RALRC with ileal conduit (IC). The WP was used in 15 consecutive patients at a single institution who all underwent RALRC with IC. All patients had preoperative bowel preparations, antibiotics, and had surgical preparation with chlorhexidine with alcohol in the standard fashion. The Alexis(R) device was placed following RALRC to protect the skin and fascia during ileal conduit formation. The ileal conduit was then created extracorporeally through the WP in the standard fashion. RALRC with IC was successfully completed in all 15 patients. Patients had no wound complications defined as documentation of cellulitis or hernia on progress or follow-up notes. Using our technique with the WP we had no cases of surgical site infection. Wound barrier protection has been recommended for use in colorectal surgery and we believe that these recommendations translate to RALRC with IC due to the use of bowel to form the urinary diversion. Further studies with the use of WP in this procedure are necessary to validate our findings.PMID: 27638828Title: Apoptotic effect of the selective PPARbeta/delta agonist GW501516 in invasive bladder cancer cells.Authors: Pechery A, Fauconnet S, Bittard H, Lascombe ISource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: GW501516 is a selective and high-affinity synthetic agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta). This molecule promoted the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis in few cancer cell lines, but its anticancer action has never been investigated in bladder tumor cells. Thus, this study was undertaken to determine whether GW501516 had antiproliferative and/or apoptotic effects on RT4 and T24 urothelial cancer cells and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that, in RT4 cells (derived from a low-grade papillary tumor), GW501516 did not induce cell death. On the other hand, in T24 cells (derived from an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma), this PPARbeta/delta agonist induced cytotoxic effects including cell morphological changes, a decrease of cell viability, a G2/M cell cycle arrest, and the cell death as evidenced by the increase of the sub-G1 cell population. Furthermore, GW501516 triggered T24 cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner including both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways through Bid cleavage. In addition, the drug led to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, a mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the dissipation of DeltaPsim, and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. GW501516 induced also ROS generation which was not responsible for T24 cell death since NAC did not rescue cells upon PPARbeta/delta agonist exposure. For the first time, our data highlight the capacity of GW501516 to induce apoptosis in invasive bladder cancer cells. This molecule could be relevant as a therapeutic drug for high-grade urothelial cancers.PMID: 27638620Title: AMPKalpha2 Regulates Bladder Cancer Growth Through SKP2-mediated Degradation of p27.Authors: Kopsiaftis S, Sullivan KL, Garg I, Taylor JA, Claffey KPSource: Mol Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 16. pii: molcanres.0111.2016.Abstract: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the central metabolic regulator of the cell and controls energy consumption based upon nutrient availability. Due to its role in energy regulation, AMPK has been implicated as a barrier for cancer progression and is suppressed in multiple cancers. To examine whether AMPK regulates bladder cancer cell growth, HTB2 and HT1376 bladder cells were treated with an AMPK activator, AICAR. AICAR treatment reduced proliferation and induced the expression of p27Kip1 (CDKN1B), which was mediated through an mTOR-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, AMPKalpha2 knockdown resulted in reduced p27 levels, whereas AMPKalpha1 suppression did not. To further determine the exact mechanism by which AMPKa2 regulates p27, HTB2 and HT1376 cells were transduced with a shRNA targeting AMPKalpha2. Stable knockdown of AMPKalpha2 resulted in increased proliferation and decreased p27 protein. The reduced p27 protein was determined to be dependent upon SKP2. Additionally, loss of AMPKalpha2 in a xenograft and a chemical carcinogen model of bladder cancer resulted in larger tumors with less p27 protein and high SKP2 levels. Consistent with the regulation observed in the bladder cancer model systems, a comprehensive survey of human primary bladder cancer clinical specimens revealed low levels of AMPKalpha2 and p27, and high levels of SKP2. IMPLICATIONS: These results highlight the contribution of AMPKalpha2 as a mechanism for controlling bladder cancer growth by regulating proliferation through mTOR suppression and induction of p27 protein levels, thus indicating how AMPKalpha2 loss may contribute to tumorigenesis.PMID: 27637910Title: The Khorana Score in Predicting Venous Thromboembolism for Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma and Variant Histology Treated With Chemotherapy.Authors: Ramos JD, Casey MF, Bamias A, De Giorgi U, Bellmunt J, Harshman LC, Ladoire S, Wong YN, Alva AS, Rosenberg JE, Galsky MD, Yu EYSource: Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2016 Sep 16. pii: 1076029616668405.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Khorana score is a predictive risk model for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer planning to receive chemotherapy. Urothelial carcinoma and variant histologies (UC/VH) were underrepresented in the model. We sought to evaluate whether the Khorana score predicts for VTE in a retrospective multinational data set of patients with metastatic UC/VH. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with metastatic UC/VH who received chemotherapy were eligible. Those with incomplete or miscoded data were excluded. Khorana scores were calculated based on the pretreatment data and categorized into high (>/=3) or intermediate (1-2) VTE risk. Other patient-, tumor-, and therapy-related factors were also analyzed. The chi2 and logistic regression analyses were used to assess differences in VTE rates based on the clinical characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the Khorana score and associated variables for early (<3 months) and late (>3 months) VTE. RESULTS: A total of 943 patients were eligible for analysis. The cumulative VTE rate was 9.9%. There was no statistical difference in overall VTE rate between Khorana high- and intermediate-risk groups (P = .16). In the multivariate analysis, nonurothelial histology (odds ratio [OR] = 2.56; P = .002) and the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors (OR = 2.14; P = .002) were associated with increased VTE risk. In the first 3 months from initiation of chemotherapy, Khorana high risk (OR = 2.08; P = .04) was associated with higher VTE rates. White blood cell (WBC) count (OR = 1.05; P = .04) was the only significant Khorana variable for early VTE. CONCLUSIONS: The Khorana score stratifies early but not overall VTE risk in patients with metastatic UC/VH. The WBC count drives the increased early VTE risk seen with the Khorana score.PMID: 27637323Title: Cell-cycle markers do not improve discrimination of EORTC and CUETO risk models in predicting recurrence and progression of non-muscle-invasive high-grade bladder cancer.Authors: Passoni N, Gayed B, Kapur P, Sagalowsky AI, Shariat SF, Lotan YSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S1078-1439(16)30066-7. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.05.014.Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess if a panel of cell-cycle markers could improve the discrimination of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) models in predicting recurrence and progression of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and January 2012, every patient with high-grade NMIBC treated with transurethral resection of bladder underwent immunohistochemical staining for 5 biomarkers (p21, p27, p53, KI-67, and cyclin E1). We excluded patients who had muscle-insvasive disease, underwent early cystectomy, and those with incomplete follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed recurrence and progression-free survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis assessed the predictive ability of markers after correcting for EORTC or CUETO risk scores. Harrel concordance index assessed for discrimination. RESULTS: There were 131 patients with a median follow-up of 31.1 months. Stage was Ta (50%), T1 (44%), and Tis (8%). For 95 patients this was the primary tumor. Intravesical therapy was used in 76% of cases of which 45% had maintenance. Recurrence-free survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 68.9%, 52.1%, and 33.2%, respectively, whereas progression-free survival rate at 6, 12, and 24 months were 93.8%, 88%, and 84.3%, respectively. No differences in survival based on number of altered markers were noted. Biomarker status was neither a significant predictor of recurrence nor progression. Marker alterations marginally improved discrimination of EORTC and CUETO models, which were confirmed to be mediocre. CONCLUSIONS: Markers were not significant predictors of recurrence nor progression in patients with high-grade NMIBC and their addition to prediction models is of little benefit.PMID: 27637184Title: [Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Information transfer from the clinic to the doctor's office : Results of a questionnaire study and presentation of a software solution].Authors: Lebentrau S, May M, Weckermann D, Speck T, Wick AK, Mathew M, Schostak MSource: Urologe A. 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The adjuvant treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is based on the individual risk profile (RP) and its sufficient transfer from the clinic to the doctor's office. The objectives of our study were to verify the importance and degree of transfer of RP and recommendation for risk-adapted adjuvant treatment (RAAT) in patients with NMIBC as well as to develop appropriate tools for this purpose, if necessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An email-based survey distributed to urologists in Brandenburg, Berlin, Bavaria and Lower Saxony explored the questions mentioned above. In addition, a tool for risk stratification and information transfer for patients with NMIBC was developed and validated. RESULTS: From a total of 134 questionnaires analyzed, 55 were from clinic urologists (CUs) and 79 were from ambulant urologists (AUs). Although 9 out of 10 urologists considered the RP of importance, only 29 % of CUs and 24 % of AUs (p = 0.553) confirmed that the RP was always mentioned in medical reports. The recommendation for RAAT was confirmed from 62 % of CUs and 20 % of AUs (p < 0.001). A recommendation for RAAT in the medical report was requested by 86 % of AUs. The risk calculator presented here - to our knowledge the first with integration of the 2004 WHO grading - is delivered in all mathematically possible constellations a RP, according to guideline recommendations. CONCLUSION: Urologists in the clinic and doctor's office both attach considerable importance to the determination and transfer of RP and the recommendation for RAAT. There was evidence to suggest an overestimation of the quality of medical reports by the CU. The risk calculator provides an easy and cost-neutral option to improve risk stratification and information transfer from the clinic to the doctor's office.PMID: 27637180Title: [Neoadjuvant therapy before radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer].Authors: Rexer H, Merseburger ASource: Urologe A. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: ?PMID: 27635763Title: Expression of steroid hormone receptors and its prognostic significance in urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.Authors: Kashiwagi E, Fujita K, Yamaguchi S, Fushimi H, Ide H, Inoue S, Mizushima T, Reis LO, Sharma R, Netto GJ, Nonomura N, Miyamoto HSource: Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Sep 16:0.Abstract: To assess the expression status of steroid hormone receptors in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC), we immunohistochemically stained for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha), ERbeta, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and progesterone receptor (PR) in 99 UUTUC specimens and paired non-neoplastic urothelial tissues. AR/ERalpha/ERbeta/GR/PR was positive in 20%/18%/62%/63%/16% of tumors, which was significantly lower (except PR) than in benign urothelial tissues [57% (P<0.001)/40% (P = 0.001)/85% (P = 0.001)/84% (P = 0.002)/13% (P = 0.529)]. There were no significant associations between each receptor expression pattern and histopathological characteristic of the tumors including tumor grade/stage. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed no significant prognostic value of each receptor expression in these 99 patients. However, patients with UUTUC positive for either ERalpha or PR had a significantly higher risk of disease-specific mortality (P = 0.025), compared with those with UUTUC negative for both. PR positivity alone in pT3 or pT4 tumors was also strongly associated with the risk of disease-specific mortality (P = 0.040). Multivariate analysis further identified the expression of ERalpha and/or PR as a strong predictor for disease-specific mortality in the entire cohort of the patients (hazard ratio, 2.434; P = 0.037). Thus, in accordance with previous observations in bladder specimens, significant decreases in the expression of AR/ERalpha/ERbeta/GR in UUTUC, compared with that in non-neoplastic urothelium, were observed. Meanwhile, the negativity of both ERalpha and PR in UUTUC as well as the negativity of PR alone in deeply invasive tumor was suggested to serve as a prognosticator.PMID: 27635313Title: Investigation of the mechanisms of action behind Electromotive Drug Administration (EMDA).Authors: Kos B, Vasquez JL, Miklavcic D, Hermann GG, Gehl JSource: PeerJ. 2016 Aug 24;4:e2309. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2309. eCollection 2016.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer is a cause of considerable morbidity worldwide. Electromotive Drug Administration is a method that combines intravesical chemotherapy with local electric field application. Electroporation has been suggested among other mechanisms as having a possible role in the therapy, so the goal of the present study was to investigate the electric fields present in the bladder wall during the treatment to determine which mechanisms might be involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electromotive Drug Administration involves applying intravesical mitomycin C with direct current of 20 mA delivered through a catheter electrode for 30 min. For numerical electric field computation we built a 3-D nonhomogeneous patient specific model based on CT images and used finite element method simulations to determine the electric fields in the whole body. RESULTS: Results indicate that highest electric field in the bladder wall was 37.7 V/m. The mean electric field magnitude in the bladder wall was 3.03 V/m. The mean magnitude of the current density in the bladder wall was 0.61 A/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that electroporation is not the mechanism of action in EMDA. A more likely explanation of the mechanism of action is iontophoretic forces increasing the mitomycin C concentration in the bladder wall.PMID: 27635065Title: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial Pathology Tissue Resource.Authors: Zhu CS, Huang WY, Pinsky PF, Berg CD, Sherman M, Yu KJ, Carrick DM, Black A, Hoover R, Lenz P, Williams C, Hawkins L, Chaloux M, Yurgalevitch S, Mathew S, Miller A, Olivo V, Khan A, Pretzel SM, Multerer D, Beckmann P, Broski KG, Freedman NDSource: Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2016 Sep 15. pii: cebp.0506.2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pathology tissue specimens with associated epidemiological and clinical data are valuable for cancer research. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial undertook a large-scale effort to create a public resource of pathology tissues from PLCO participants who developed a cancer during the trial. METHODS: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were obtained from pathology laboratories on a loan basis for central processing of tissue microarrays, with additional free-standing tissue cores collected for nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: Pathology tissue specimens have been obtained for prostate cancer (n=1,052), lung cancer (n=434), colorectal cancer (n=673) and adenoma (n=658), ovarian cancer and borderline tumors (n=212), breast cancer (n=870) and bladder cancer (n=201). The process of creating this resource was complex, involving multi-disciplinary teams with expertise in pathology, epidemiology, information technology, project management and specialized laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: Creating the PLCO tissue resource required a multi-step process including obtaining medical records and contacting pathology departments where pathology materials were stored after obtaining necessary patient consent and authorization. The potential to link tissue biomarkers to prospectively collected epidemiological information, screening and clinical data, and matched blood or buccal samples offers valuable opportunities to study etiologic heterogeneity, mechanisms of carcinogenesis and biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. IMPACT: The methods and protocols developed for this effort, and the detailed description of this resource provided here will be useful for those seeking to use PLCO pathology tissue specimens for their research and may also inform future tissue collection efforts in other settings.PMID: 27634899Title: Bladder neck preservation improves time to continence after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Authors: Ma X, Tang K, Yang C, Wu G, Xu N, Wang M, Zeng X, Hu Z, Song R, Yuh B, Wang Z, Ye ZSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11997.Abstract: Bladder neck preservation (BNP) during radical prostatectomy (RP) may improve postoperative urinary continence, although its overall effectiveness remains controversial. We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, CBM and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published before February 2016 that assessed associations between BNP and post-RP urinary continence. Thirteen trials (1130 cases and 1154 controls) assessing BNP versus noBNP (or with bladder neck reconstruction, BNR) were considered suitable for meta-analysis, including two randomized controlled trials (RCT), six prospective and five retrospective studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated that BNP improved early urinary continence rates (6 mo, OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.21-2.27; P = 0.001) and long-term urinary continence outcomes (>12 mo, OR = 3.99; 95% CI, 1.94-8.21; P = 0.0002). Patients with BNP also had lower bladder neck stricture frequencies (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.81; P = 0.006). Anastomotic leak rates, positive surgical margins and biochemical failure rates were comparable between the two groups (P>0.05). There were no differences in baseline characteristics except for a smaller average prostate volume (WMD = -2.24 ml; 95% CI, -4.27 to -0.22; P = 0.03) in BNP patients. Our analyses indicated that BNP during RP improved early recovery and overall long-term (1 year) urinary continence and decreased bladder neck stricture rates without compromising oncologic control.PMID: 27632928Title: Rare variants in BRCA2 and CHEK2 are associated with the risk of urinary tract cancers.Authors: Ge Y, Wang Y, Shao W, Jin J, Du M, Ma G, Chu H, Wang M, Zhang ZSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 16;6:33542. doi: 10.1038/srep33542.Abstract: Previous studies have shown that two rare variants, rs11571833 in BRCA2 and rs17879961 in CHEK2 were associated with lung cancer. However, the associations between these two variants and urinary tract cancers risk remain largely unexplored. We applied imputation of three genome-wide association studies published in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). Unconditional logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis were performed to assess the association between these two variants and the risk of urinary tract cancers. Our results showed that rs11571833[T] had an effect on urinary tract cancers predisposition (ORmeta = 1.45, Pmeta = 0.013), especially associated with increased the risk of bladder cancer (ORmeta = 1.60, Pmeta = 0.010). Moreover, rs17879961[C] had a protective effect on the urinary tract cancers (ORmeta = 0.67, Pmeta = 1.0 x 10(-3)) and was mostly associated with a lower incidence of renal cell carcinoma (ORmeta = 0.51, Pmeta = 2.0 x 10(-3)). Together, our study indicates that BRCA2 and CHEK2 play an important role in the genetic susceptibility to urinary tract cancers.PMID: 27631965Title: LINC00312 inhibits the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by targeting miR-197-3p.Authors: Wang YY, Wu ZY, Wang GC, Liu K, Niu XB, Gu S, Meng JSSource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 8.Abstract: To investigate the influence of the long non-coding RNA LINC00312 on bladder cancer (BC) cell invasion and metastasis by targeting miR-197-3p. BC and corresponding adjacent tissues were collected. LINC00312 and miR-197-3p were measured, and their correlation was detected through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). BC cell line T24 was transfected and grouped (five groups) according to different transfection conditions. A scratch test was applied to analyze cell migration, and a Transwell assay was used to test cell invasion ability. Western blotting was to measure matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) protein levels. qRT-PCR indicated that LINC00312 expression was lower but miR-197-3p expression was higher in BC tissues compared with adjacent tissues; LINC00312 was negatively correlated with miR-197-3p. The migration test revealed that the downregulation of miR-197-3p and overexpression of LINC00312 inhibited cell migration and invasion abilities, while the overexpression of miR-197-3p and the upregulation of LINC00312 promoted cell migration and invasion. BC cells with downregulated miR-197-3p or upregulated LINC00312 had low MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels but high TIMP2. LINC00312 inhibited BC cell invasion and metastasis through mediating miR-197-3p.PMID: 27631522Title: Yolk Sac Tumor in Extragonadal Pelvic Sites: Still a Diagnostic Challenge.Authors: Ravishankar S, Malpica A, Ramalingam P, Euscher EDSource: Am J Surg Pathol. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: We present the clinicopathologic features of 15 cases of extragonadal yolk sac tumor (EGYST) detected in female patients and reviewed at our institution from 1988 to 2016. We recorded: patient age, clinical presentation, tumor location, FIGO stage (where applicable), histologic patterns including presence/absence of Schiller-Duval bodies, other germ cell or somatic components, immunoperoxidase results, treatment, and outcome. Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 87 (median, 62) years and presentation included: abnormal uterine bleeding, 12; hematuria, 1; labial mass, 1; abdominal pain, 1. Primary sites were as follows: uterus (11), vagina (1), vulva (1), bladder (1), and peritoneum (1). Seven patients presented at FIGO stage III or IV. The following histologic patterns were observed: microcystic/reticular (7), glandular (8), solid (8), papillary (5), and hepatoid (1). An admixture of histologic patterns was present in 10 cases. Schiller-Duval bodies were seen in only 3 (23%) cases. Eight cases (46%), all uterine primaries, had associated somatic components, and 2 (15%) had a second germ cell component. In 13/14 (93%) cases, the yolk sac tumor component was either missed or misclassified as adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase studies facilitated the diagnosis in all cases as follows: SALL4, 12/12; CDX2, 10/12; alpha fetoprotein, 7/14; glypican-3, 9/10; cytokeratin 20, 5/9 (rare cells); cytokeratin 7, 3/12 (nondiffuse); PAX8, 2/9 (variable expression). All patients received chemotherapy and all except 1 underwent surgical resection. Follow-up from 5 to 86 months was available for 13 patients: 5 died of disease, 6 are alive with disease, and 2 have no evidence of disease. EGYST arising in the female pelvis of peri/postmenopausal patients may be associated with a somatic component and represent either somatically derived YST or YST differentiation within a somatic carcinoma. EGYST in younger patients is likely a true germ cell neoplasm, and may respond to germ cell appropriate chemotherapy. The benefit of germ cell appropriate chemotherapy in somatically derived EGYST is less clear. Awareness that the presence of glandular or microcystic patterns may lead to under-recognition or misdiagnosis of EGYST in combination with immunomarkers for germ cell and yolk sac differentiation will facilitate the diagnosis.PMID: 27631264Title: The relationship between GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer susceptibility: A meta-analysis.Authors: Yu Y, Li X, Liang C, Tang J, Qin Z, Wang C, Xu W, Hua Y, Shao P, Xu TSource: Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Sep;95(37):e4900. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004900.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have investigated the relationship between GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BCa) susceptibility, respectively, but the results remain inconsistent. So, we conducted this meta-analysis including 79 case-control studies to explore such relationships. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and CNKI for relevant available studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were implemented to evaluate the intensity of associations. Publication bias was estimated using Begg funnel plots and Egger regression test. To assess the stability of the results, we used sensitivity analysis with the method of calculating the results again by omitting 1 single study each time. Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the I statistic. RESULTS: No significant association between GSTA1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.33) was noted. Besides, meaningful association between individuals who carried the GSTM1 null genotype and increased BCa risk was detected (OR = 1.39, 95%CI 1.28-1.51). When stratified by ethnicity, significant difference was found in both Caucasian (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.58) and Asian populations (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.31-1.61). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by source of controls (SOC), the results were significant in both hospital-based control groups (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.35-1.64) and population-based control groups (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.37). Additionally, the analysis revealed no significant association between GSTP1 polymorphism and BCa risk (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.20). What is more, significant associations between GSTT1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility were discovered (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.22). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant associations between GSTT1 null genotype and BCa risk were observed only in Caucasians (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44). Furthermore, when stratified by SOC, no obvious relationship was found between the GSTT1 null genotype polymorphism with hospital-based population (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.97-1.28) or population-based population (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.96-1.27). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that GSTM1 null genotype and GSTT1 null genotype might be related to higher BCa risk, respectively. However, no associations were observed between GSTA1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and BCa susceptibility.PMID: 27631180Title: Evaluation of miR-182/miR-100 Ratio for Diagnosis and Survival Prediction in Bladder Cancer.Authors: Chen Z, Wu L, Lin Q, Shi J, Lin X, Shi LSource: Arch Iran Med. 2016 Sep;19(9):645-51. doi: 0161909/AIM.008.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays an important role in development of several cancer types, including bladder cancer (BCa). However, the relationship between the ratio of miR-181/miR-100 and the prognosis of BCa has not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of miR-182, miR-100 and their clinical significance in BCa. METHODS: Upregulation of miR-182 and down-regulation of miR-100 were validated in tissue specimens of 134 BCa cases compared with 148 normal bladder epithelia (NBE) specimens using TaqMan-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of miR-182, miR-100, and miR-182/miR-100 ratio was also performed. RESULTS: miR-182 was upregulated in BCa and miR-100 was down-regulated in BCa compared with NBE (P < 0.001). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs-ROC) for miR-182 and miR-100 were 0.913 and 0.810, respectively. However, miR-182/miR-100 ratio increased the diagnostic performance, yielding an AUC of 0.981 (97.01% sensitivity and 90.54% specificity). Moreover, miR-182/miR-100 ratio was associated with pT-stage, histological grade, BCa recurrence and carcinoma in situ (P < 0.05 for all). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-182/miR-100 ratio was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Hazard ratio: 7.142; 95% CI: 2.106 - 9.891; P < 0.01). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that high-level of miR-182/miR-100 ratio was significantly correlated with shortened survival time for BCa patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The miR-182/miR-100 ratio may serve as a novel promising biomarker for diagnosis and survival prediction in BCa. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of miR-182/miR-100 ratio as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for BCa.PMID: 27630347Title: Feasibility and Safety of Laparoscopic Total Mesometrial Resection in Early-stage Cervical Cancer.Authors: Nasser S, Almuheimid J, Plett H, Sehouli J, Muallem MZSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4903-7.Abstract: AIM: In this study we aimed to analyze the safety and feasibility of total mesometrial resection (TMMR) using the laparoscopic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Laparoscopic TMMR and pelvic lymphadenectomy (LNE) was carried out in 34 patients with cervical cancer FIGO IA-IIB from April 2012-April 2016 at our tertiary center. Para-aortic LNE was performed when indicated. The main outcomes included surgical margins, a number of retrieved lymph node, intra- and post-operative complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Complete microscopic tumor resection was confirmed in 33/34 (97%) patients. No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean intra-operative blood loss was only 65.2 ml with no blood transfusions required. Intra-operative complications occurred in 4/34 (11.8%) cases (2 bladder injuries and 2 ureteric injuries). Post-operative complications were observed in 10/35 (29.4%) cases. Only one complication occurred after 30 days (vesico-vaginal fistula). There was a loco-regional recurrence within a mean follow-up time of 25.9 months. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic TMMR appears to be feasible and safe in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. Further large-scale studies are required.PMID: 27630325Title: Radiotherapy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer in Very Elderly Patients.Authors: Maebayashi T, Ishibashi N, Aizawa T, Sakaguchi M, Sato K, Matsui T, Yamaguchi K, Takahashi SSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4763-9.Abstract: AIM: The standard therapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical total cystectomy; however, radiotherapy (RT) is performed in patients who cannot tolerate surgery due to advanced age. This study aimed to retrospectively examine whether the feasibility of concurrent use of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) can be assessed using both treatment results of RT for MIBC in elderly patients and the G8 Screening Tool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 16 patients who had received intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (IACRT) or RT alone between February 2004 and December 2012. The median age was 83 (range=75-91) years. Twelve patients had stage II and 4 had stage III disease. Ten patients received IACRT and six received RT alone. In order to determine whether the G8 score distinguishes patients for treatment with IACRT or RT alone, we calculated the cut-off of the G8 score for addition of IAC. RESULTS: The overall median G8 score was 12 (range=9-15), with scores of 13 (range=12-15) in the IACRT group and 10 (range=9-11) in the RT-alone group. The G8 score was 12 or more in all patients in the IACRT group. The median follow-up period was 35 (range=6-64) months. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 80% and 66.7% in the IACRT group. The 1- and 2-year survival rates in the RT-alone group were 50% and 25%, respectively. Regarding late adverse events, only one patient experienced grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. CONCLUSION: IACRT was considered to be useful for the treatment of MIBC in elderly patients, with tolerable adverse events. Moreover, used in conjunction with age and performance status, the G8 Screening Tool is potentially applicable for determining the feasibility of performing IAC. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the correlation between G8 score and feasibility of IAC.PMID: 27630289Title: Association of Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) Genotypes with Bladder Cancer Risk in Taiwan.Authors: Chang WS, Liao CH, Tsai CW, Hu PS, Wu HC, Hsu SW, Hsiao CL, Hsu CH, Hung YW, Bau DTSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4509-14.Abstract: AIM: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and its incidence is particularly high in many developed regions including southwestern Taiwan. However, the genetic contribution to the etiology of bladder cancer is not well-understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) genotypes with Taiwan bladder cancer risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three polymorphic variants of EZH2 were analyzed regarding their association with bladder cancer risk, and three hundred and seventy-five patients with bladder cancer and same number of age- and gender-matched healthy controls recruited were genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Among the three polymorphic sites examined, the genotypes of EZH2 rs887569 (C to T), but not rs41277434 (A to C) or rs3757441 (T to C), were positively associated with bladder cancer risk (p for trend =0.0146). Individuals with the EZH2 rs887569 TT genotypes were associated with decreased cancer risk than those with wild-type CC genotype. The stratified analyses showed that EZH2 rs887569 TT genotypes had protective effects on non-smokers but obviously not on smokers. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that the T allele of EZH2 rs887569 may be associated with the lower risk of bladder cancer development, especially among non-smokers.PMID: 27629559Title: Incidence of bladder cancer after radiation for prostate cancer as a function of time and radiation modality.Authors: Keehn A, Ludmir E, Taylor J, Rabbani FSource: World J Urol. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of BlCa developing after radiation for PCa, stratified by ethnicity and follow-up duration. METHODS: The 1973-2011 surveillance, epidemiology and end results database was used to determine the observed and expected number of BlCa after PCa radiation. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) of developing BlCa were calculated for the various radiation modalities relative to no radiation, stratified by ethnicity and follow-up duration. BlCa characteristics were compared between patients with a history of prostate radiation and those without PCa. RESULTS: PCa was radiated in 346,429 men, 6401 of whom developed BlCa versus 2464 expected cases [SIR (95 % CI) of 2.60 (2.53-2.66)]. All radiation modalities were found to have an increased RR of developing BlCa after 10 years, with brachytherapy having a significantly higher RR than external beam radiation (EBRT) or combined EBRT and brachytherapy in Caucasian men and a significantly higher RR than EBRT in men of other/unknown ethnicity. Post-radiation BlCa, in particular that after brachytherapy, had higher grade (P = 0.0001) and lower stage (P = 0.0001) versus the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of BlCa after prostate radiation occurs predominantly after 10 years, regardless of ethnicity. The RR of developing BlCa after 10 years is significantly higher following brachytherapy than after EBRT or EBRT and brachytherapy. Bladder cancers after prostate radiation, especially after brachytherapy, are generally lower stage but higher grade than those in patients without PCa.PMID: 27629128Title: Urodynamic assessment of short-term effects of pelvic radiotherapy on bladder function in patients with gynecologic cancers.Authors: Emirdar V, Nayki U, Ertas IE, Nayki C, Kulhan M, Yildirim YSource: Ginekol Pol. 2016;87(8):552-8. doi: 10.5603/GP.2016.0043.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the short-term effects of adjuvant or primary curative radiotherapy (RT) on the urinary system in women with gynecologic cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective, concurrent cohort study including 55 patients with gynecologic cancer who were divided into three groups. Group 1 included 10 patients who were administered adjuvant RT following a radical hysterectomy (RH); Group 2 included 36 patients who were administered adjuvant RT following a type 1 hysterectomy and Group 3 included 9 patients who were administered primary curative RT. Urogynecologic assessments were carried out on patients before and six months after the treatment. RESULTS: Compared to pretreatment, no significant differences were observed in any of the three groups after treatment in terms of incontinence, first urge to urinate, normal urge to urinate, severe urge to urinate and changes in residual urine volumes. There was a significant decrease in maximal vesical pressure after treatment in Group 1 and Group 3. The maxi-mum detrusor pressure decreased significantly in Group 1. The post-treatment decline in bladder capacity in Group 1 and Group 2 was also significant. CONCLUSIONS: RH and pelvic RT cause lower urinary system dysfunction. Especially patients who receive primary curative RT and patients who are administered RT after RH, where more pelvic denervation occurs, are at higher risk due to high doses of RT.PMID: 27628846Title: Re: Regulation of UHRF1 by Dual-Strand Tumor-Suppressor MicroRNA-145 (miR-145-5p and miR-145-3p): Inhibition of Bladder Cancer Cell Aggressiveness.Authors: Atala ASource: J Urol. 2016 Oct;196(4):1314. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2016.07.048.

BACKGROUND: It is suggested that IUCs should be clamped intermittently to fill the bladder and restore bladder function before removal. However, IUC clamping showed no effect on bladder reconditioning according to some clinical studies. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. METHODS: A total of 210 cervical cancer patients after type C radical hysterectomy were randomized on 1:2 into two groups. In the clamping group IUCs were clamped intermittently for 48 hrs before removal based on a bladder-training sheet, while in the control group the IUCs were removed without clamping. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of recatheterization. The secondary outcomes included residual urine volume (RUV) 24 hrs after removal, incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and duration of recatheterization. RESULTS: Seventy patients were assigned to the clamping group and 128 to the control group with paralleled baseline characteristics. The days of the primary catheterization (13.20+/-0.79 vs 13.38+/-1.04) and the incidence of UTI (22.9% vs 20.3%) had no significant differences between the two groups. Ten patients in the clamping group and 19 in the control group underwent recatheterization, the incidence of which showed no significant difference (14.3% vs 14.8%). The days of recatheterization were not statistically different between the two groups (11.40+/-6.75 vs 9.42+/-5.23). However, the RUV 24 hrs after removal was higher in the clamping group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder recondition through IUC clamping may not restore bladder function in patients after radical hysterectomy. This article is protected by copyright.

The data showed forty five proteins were found to be differentially expressed comparing tumors vs non-tumor tissues, of which EGFR and cdc2p34 were correlated with muscle invasion and histological grade. Ten proteins (ss-catenin, HSP70, autotaxin, Notch4, PSTPIP1, DPYD, ODC, cyclinB1, calretinin and EPO) were able to classify muscle invasive BCa (MIBC) into 2 distinct groups, with group 2 associated with poorer survival. Finally, 3 proteins (P2X7, cdc25B and TFIIH p89) were independent factors for favorable overall survival.PMID: 27626311Title: Immunohistochemical correlates of TP53 somatic mutations in cancer.Authors: Murnyak B, Hortobagyi TSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 8. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11912.Abstract: Despite controversy on the correlation between p53 accumulation and TP53 mutational status, immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of overexpressed protein has long been used as a surrogate method for mutation analysis. The aim of our study was to characterise the IHC expression features of TP53 somatic mutations and define their occurrence in human cancers. A large-scale database analysis was conducted in the IARC TP53 Database (R17); 7878 mutations with IHC features were retrieved representing 60 distinct tumour sites. The majority of the alterations were immunopositive (p <0.001). Sex was known for 4897 mutations showing a female dominance (57.2%) and females carrying negative mutations were significantly younger. TP53 mutations were divided into three IHC groups according to mutation frequency and IHC positivity. Each group had female dominance. Among the IHC groups, significant correlations were observed with age at diagnosis in breast, bladder, liver, haematopoietic system and head & neck cancers. An increased likelihood of false negative IHC associated with rare nonsense mutations was observed in certain tumour sites. Our study demonstrates that p53 immunopositivity largely correlates with TP53 mutational status but expression is absent in certain mutation types.Besides, describing the complex IHC expression of TP53 somatic mutations, our results reveal some caveats for the diagnostic practice.PMID: 27625155Title: Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and cancer among survivors of myocardial infarction: A 20-year follow-up study.Authors: Cohen G, Levy I, Yuval, Kark JD, Levin N, Broday DM, Steinberg DM, Gerber YSource: Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2016 Sep 13. pii: 2047487316669415.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested a carcinogenic effect of exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Recently, higher rates of cancer incidence were observed among myocardial infarction survivors compared with the general population. We examined the association between chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides, a proxy measure for traffic-related air pollution, and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients. METHODS: Patients aged </=65 years admitted to hospital in central Israel with a first myocardial infarction in 1992-1993 were followed to 2013 for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality. Data on sociodemographic and cancer risk factors were obtained, including time-varying information on smoking. Using land use regression models, annual averages of nitrogen oxides during follow-up were estimated individually according to home addresses. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to study the relationships with cancer outcomes. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 16 (SD 7) years, 262 incident cancers and 105 cancer deaths were identified among 1393 cancer-free patients at baseline (mean age 54 years; 81% men). In adjusted models, a 10 ppb increase in mean nitrogen oxide exposure was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.18) for cancer incidence and HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93-1.26) for cancer mortality. The association with lung, bladder, kidney or prostate cancer (previously linked to air pollution) was stronger (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution may constitute an environmental risk factor for cancer post-myocardial infarction. Variation in the strength of association between specific cancers needs to be explored further.PMID: 27625017Title: A Case of Huge Solitary Fibrous Tumor in Bladder.Authors: Tong XN, Cheng T, Zhang M, Zhang SY, Li S, Gao Y, Shuang WBSource: Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2016 Jul 29. pii: S1558-7673(16)30220-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clgc.2016.07.017.Abstract: ?PMID: 27624974Title: DNA methylation in urothelial carcinoma.Authors: Schulz WA, Goering WSource: Epigenomics. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: DNA methylation alterations are common in urothelial carcinoma, a prevalent cancer worldwide caused predominantly by chemical carcinogens. Recent studies have proposed sets of hypermethylated genes as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers from urine or tissue samples, which require validation. Other studies have revealed intriguing links between specific carcinogens and DNA methylation alterations in cancer tissues or blood that might clarify carcinogenesis mechanisms and aid prevention. Like DNA methylation alterations, mutations in chromatin regulators are frequent, underlining the importance of epigenetic changes. However, the relations between the two changes and their functions in urothelial carcinogenesis remain unclear. Transcription factor genes with altered methylation deserve particular interest. Elucidating the functional impact of methylation changes is a prerequisite for their therapeutic targeting.PMID: 27624465Title: The multidimensional burden of informal caregivers in primary malignant brain tumor.Authors: Bayen E, Laigle-Donadey F, Proute M, Hoang-Xuan K, Joel ME, Delattre JYSource: Support Care Cancer. 2016 Sep 13.Abstract: PURPOSE: Informal caregivers (ICs) provide care and improve the quality of life of patients with malignant brain tumor. We analyze the impact of their involvement on themselves from a triple perspective. METHODS: Home-dwelling patients with primary malignant brain tumor underwent a medical examination. ICs burden was evaluated by a self-administered postal questionnaire. Objective burden (Informal Care Time, ICT), subjective burden (Zarit Burden Inventory, ZBI), and financial burden (valuation of lost earnings using the Replacement and Opportunity Cost Methods, RCM, OCM) were evaluated. RESULTS: ICs (N = 84) were principally women (87 %) and spouses (64 %), of mean age 55 years, who assisted patients of mean age 53 years and with a mean KPS score of 61 (range = 30-90, med = 60). Subjective burden was moderate (mean ZBI = 30). Objective burden was high (mean ICT = 11.7 h/day), mostly consisting of supervision time. Higher subjective and objective burden were associated with poorer functional status (KPS) but not with a higher level of cognitive disorders in multivariate analyses. Other independent associated factors were bladder dysfunction and co-residency for objective burden and working and a poor social network for subjective burden. The 56 working ICs made work arrangements (75 %) that impacted their wages (36 %) and careers (30 %). Financial burden due to uncompensated caregiving hours for Activities of Daily Living had a mean monetary value from capital JE, Ukrainian677(RCM) to capital JE, Ukrainian1683(OCM) per month (i.e., ranging from capital JE, Ukrainian8124 to capital JE, Ukrainian20196 per year). CONCLUSIONS: IC burden is multidimensional. Greater provision of formal care, more IC support programs, and economic interventions targeting IC employment and finances are needed.PMID: 27623735Title: The comparison of 5-field conformal radiotherapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer: The best for femoral head sparing.Authors: Zare M, Lashkari M, Ghalehtaki R, Ghasemi A, Dehghan Manshadi H, Mir A, Noorollahi S, Alamolhoda MSource: Med Dosim. 2016 Sep 10. pii: S0958-3947(16)30058-9. doi: 10.1016/j.meddos.2016.06.008.Abstract: External radiotherapy is a standard treatment procedure for localized prostate cancer. Given the relatively high long term survival treatment complications have been brought in center of attention. In this planning study, between 2012 and 2014, CT simulation data of 90 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients were collected. In the first phase, all were planned for whole pelvis irradiation up to 46Gy in 23 daily fractions. In the second phase, only the prostate gland was the target of radiation. Next, the subjects were divided randomly into three groups and each received a unique 5field conformal radiation plan including Plan A (Gantry angle: 0, 60, 120, 240, and 300), Plan B (Gantry angles: 0, 90, 120, 240, and 270) and Plan C (Gantry angles: 0, 60, 90, 270, and 300). The total dose was 70Gy. For each patient, the rectum, bladder, and both femoral heads were contoured as the at risk organs (OAR). From dose volume histograms, the proportional dose of PTV V100, the bladder and rectum V80 and V90 and femoral head V50 and V100 were calculated in all subjects and compared across plans. A statistically significant difference in the femoral head V50 and V100 was found between our studied 5field plans so that in Plan A (beam angles: 0, 60, 120, 240 and 300) less dose was received by both heads of femur. This study suggests that 5 field treatment planning including an anterior, two anterior oblique and two posterior oblique portals to be more proper for 3D conformal radiotherapy in order to spare femoral head with acceptable PTV coverage, and bladder and rectal doses.PMID: 27622605Title: Lentivirus-mediated p21/Waf-1 short hairpin RNA enhances the cytotoxic effects and replicative potential of a bladder cancer-specific oncolytic adenovirus in vitro.Authors: Shi J, Fu S, Wang L, Tao Y, Rodriguez R, Wang ZSource: Anticancer Drugs. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: Our previous work confirmed that the bladder cancer-specific oncolytic adenovirus Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A could selectively replicate in bladder cancer cells, thus causing specific tumor cell lysis. The replicative potential is a crucial factor in determining the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses. However, viral replication is attenuated by the low-activity promoter that we used, thus compromising viral cytotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the effect of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Waf-1 on an adenovirus. We used lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA to knock down p21/Waf-1 in two bladder cancer cell lines EJ and 5637. The p21/Waf-1 knockdown not only induced stronger cytopathic effects but also augmented apoptosis, which was closely associated with the enhancement of Fas and the subsequent significant activation of caspase-3. A replicative assay showed that p21/Waf-1 knockdown increased the viral particle production. Western blot analysis confirmed that p21/Waf-1 knockdown upregulated the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and two adenovirus replication indicators E1A and hexon. A luciferase activity assay indicated higher transcriptional activity of the uroplakin II (UPII) promoter in the p21/Waf-1 knockdown cells, and one possible mechanism could be that the increased expression of AR induced the UPII promoter through the AR-binding sites of the prostate stem cell antigen enhancer. These findings indicating that p21/Waf-1 knockdown could enhance cell killing and viral replication have significant implications for the development of bladder cancer-specific oncolytic adenovirus therapies.PMID: 27621760Title: Epithelial plasticity in urothelial carcinoma: Current advancements and future challenges.Authors: Garg MSource: World J Stem Cells. 2016 Aug 26;8(8):260-7. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v8.i8.260.Abstract: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is characterized by high recurrence rate where a subset of these cells undergoes transition to deadly muscle invasive disease and later metastasizes. Urothelial cancer stem cells (UroCSCs), a tumor subpopulation derived from transformation of urothelial stem cells, are responsible for heterogeneous tumor formation and resistance to systemic treatment in UC of the bladder. Although the precise reason for pathophysiologic spread of tumor is not clear, transcriptome analysis of microdissected cancer cells expressing multiple progenitor/stem cell markers validates the upregulation of genes that derive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Experimental studies on human bladder cancer xenografts describe the mechanistic functions and regulation of epithelial plasticity for its cancer-restraining effects. It has been further examined to be associated with the recruitment of a pool of UroCSCs into cell division in response to damages induced by adjuvant therapies. This paper also discusses the various probable therapeutic approaches to attenuate the progressive manifestation of chemoresistance by co-administration of inhibitors of epithelial plasticity and chemotherapeutic drugs by abrogating the early tumor repopulation as well as killing differentiated cancer cells.PMID: 27621620Title: In vivo assessment of bone marrow toxicity by gold nanoparticle-based bioconjugates in Crl:CD1(ICR) mice.Authors: Berce C, Lucan C, Petrushev B, Boca S, Miclean M, Sarpataki O, Astilean S, Buzoianu A, Tomuleasa C, Bojan ASource: Int J Nanomedicine. 2016 Sep 1;11:4261-73. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S108711. eCollection 2016.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed at evaluating the biodistribution of Tween((R)) 20-gold nanoparticle (GNP) conjugates and their potential toxicity on the bone marrow before moving on to Phase I clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tween((R)) 20-conjugated GNPs were injected intravenously for 21 days in male Crl:CD1(ICR) mice. Body weight of the mice was evaluated each day. After the sub-chronic Tween((R)) 20-GNPs administration, blood samples were harvested, and a full blood count was done individually. Total Au quantity from all major organs was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. One femur and the sternum obtained from each animal were used for histological assessment. RESULTS: Our data showed that the Tween((R)) 20-GNP conjugates were found in large quantities in the bladder. Au was shown to accumulate in the hematopoietic bone tissue, with significant side effects such as leucopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. The mice had a higher white blood cell and platelet count as opposed to the control group. This suggested that the previously described leukopenic effects of isoflurane were overridden by the leucopoietic effects of Tween((R)) 20-GNPs. CONCLUSION: It was uncertain whether the mice were reactive to Au as it is a foreign substance to the tissues or whether the side effects observed were a precursor condition of a more severe hematological condition. Au was found to be hepatotoxic, urging the need for further studies in order to achieve better in vivo compliance and exploit the immense potential of GNPs in cancer pharmacology.PMID: 27621615Title: Multicomponent, peptide-targeted glycol chitosan nanoparticles containing ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes for bladder cancer multimodal imaging.Authors: Key J, Dhawan D, Cooper CL, Knapp DW, Kim K, Kwon IC, Choi K, Park K, Decuzzi P, Leary JFSource: Int J Nanomedicine. 2016 Aug 29;11:4141-55. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S109494. eCollection 2016.Abstract: While current imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography, and positron emission tomography, play an important role in detecting tumors in the body, no single-modality imaging possesses all the functions needed for a complete diagnostic imaging, such as spatial resolution, signal sensitivity, and tissue penetration depth. For this reason, multimodal imaging strategies have become promising tools for advanced biomedical research and cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. In designing multimodal nanoparticles, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles should be engineered so that they successfully accumulate at the tumor site and minimize nonspecific uptake by other organs. Finely altering the nano-scale properties can dramatically change the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of nanoparticles in the body. In this study, we engineered multimodal nanoparticles for both MRI, by using ferrimagnetic nanocubes (NCs), and near infrared fluorescence imaging, by using cyanine 5.5 fluorescence molecules. We changed the physicochemical properties of glycol chitosan nanoparticles by conjugating bladder cancer-targeting peptides and loading many ferrimagnetic iron oxide NCs per glycol chitosan nanoparticle to improve MRI contrast. The 22 nm ferrimagnetic NCs were stabilized in physiological conditions by encapsulating them within modified chitosan nanoparticles. The multimodal nanoparticles were compared with in vivo MRI and near infrared fluorescent systems. We demonstrated significant and important changes in the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrated that multimodal nanoparticles specifically visualize small tumors and show minimal accumulation in other organs. This work reveals the importance of finely modulating physicochemical properties in designing multimodal nanoparticles for bladder cancer imaging.PMID: 27621100Title: Leiomyoma of Urinary Bladder Presenting with Febrile Urinary Tract Infection: A Case Report.Authors: Haddad RG, Murshidi MM, Abu Shahin N, Murshidi MMSource: Int J Surg Case Rep. 2016 Sep 7;27:180-182. doi: 10.1016/j.ijscr.2016.08.045.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Leiomyomas of urinary bladder constitute only about 0.43% of all bladder tumors. Only about 250 cases were reported in English literature. This is the first reported case of bladder leiomyoma to present with febrile urinary tract infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 37- year old male who presented with febrile urinary tract infection. Imaging showed a bladder lesion. This lesion was managed by transurethral resection. Pathologic diagnosis was bladder leiomyoma. DISCUSSION: Although bladder leiomyomas are benign, they can cause serious sequelae, including serious urinary tract infections as the case we present here shows. This is why it is important to early diagnose and treat this condition. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of early introduction of imaging in patients presenting with severe urinary tract infections. Failure to diagnose this lesion as the underlying cause of infection may have easily led to recurrence of similar severe life-threatening infections.PMID: 27620629Title: Precise positioning of cancerous cells on PDMS substrates with gradients of elasticity.Authors: Raczkowska J, Prauzner-Bechcicki SSource: Biomed Microdevices. 2016 Oct;18(5):90. doi: 10.1007/s10544-016-0110-y.Abstract: In this work the novel method to create PDMS substrates with continuous and discrete elasticity gradients of different shapes and dimensions over the large areas was introduced. Elastic properties of the sample were traced using force spectroscopy (FS) and quantitative imaging (QI) mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Then, fluorescence microscopy was applied to investigate the effect of elastic properties on proliferation of bladder cancer cells (HCV29). Obtained results show that cancerous cells proliferate significantly more effective on soft PDMS, whereas the stiff one is almost cell-repellant. This strong impact of substrate elasticity on cellular behavior is driving force enabling precise positioning of cells.PMID: 27620069Title: Histone deacetylase inhibitors: Future therapeutics for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Authors: Sharma S, Taliyan RSource: Pharmacol Res. 2016 Sep 9;113(Pt A):320-326. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2016.09.009.Abstract: Insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and predisposes the affected individuals to a variety of pathologies, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemias, hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc. Insulin resistance is the primary cause of T2DM and it occurs many years before the disease onset. Although Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are outstanding insulin sensitizers and are in clinical use since 1990s, however, their serious side effects such as heart attack and bladder cancer have limited their utilization. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify a new class of drugs with insulin sensitizing activity and minimal side effects. In the recent years, Histone deacetylase (HDAC) has emerged as a new molecular target in the control of insulin resistance and T2DM. The level of histone acetylation/deacetylation has been found to be altered during insulin resistance and T2DM conditions. HDAC inhibitors have been found to effectively manage insulin resistance and T2DM in various preclinical models and clinical trials. In this review we will focus on various aspects related to regulation of insulin signalling by HDACs and the future scope of HDAC inhibitors as therapeutics for insulin resistance.PMID: 27618773Title: Bladder cancer: Two molecular subtypes identified.Authors: Stone LSource: Nat Rev Urol. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.1038/nrurol.2016.178.Abstract: ?PMID: 27618280Title: Biocompatible astaxanthin as novel contrast agent for biomedical imaging.Authors: Nguyen VP, Park S, Oh J, Wook Kang HSource: J Biophotonics. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.1002/jbio.201600159.Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a hybrid imaging modality with high resolution and sensitivity that can be beneficial for cancer staging. Due to insufficient endogenous photoacoustic (PA) contrast, the development of exogenous agents is critical in targeting cancerous tumors. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of marine-oriented material, astaxanthin, as a biocompatible PA contrast agent. Both silicon tubing phantoms and ex vivo bladder tissues are tested at various concentrations (up to 5 mg/ml) of astaxanthin to quantitatively explore variations in PA responses. A Q-switched Nd : YAG laser (lambda = 532 nm) in conjunction with a 5 MHz ultrasound transducer is employed to generate and acquire PA signals from the samples. The phantom results presented that the PA signal amplitudes increase linearly with the astaxanthin concentrations (threshold detection = 0.31 mg/ml). The tissue injected with astaxanthin yields up to 16-fold higher PA signals, compared with that with saline. Due to distribution of the injected astaxanthin, PAI can image the margin of astaxanthin boles as well as quantify their volume in 3D reconstruction. Further investigations on selective tumor targeting are required to validate astaxanthin as a potential biocompatible contrast agent for PAI-assisted bladder cancer detection.PMID: 27617552Title: Failure of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Definition and treatment options.Authors: Gual Frau J, Palou J, Rodriguez O, Parada R, Breda A, Villavicencio HSource: Arch Esp Urol. 2016 Sep;69(7):423-33.Abstract: Adjuvant intravesical bacillus Calmette- Guerin (BCG) therapy is the standard conservative adjuvant treatment and the most effective regimen for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The term "BCG failure" is generally used to refer to recurrence or progression following BCG therapy, as experienced by many patients. However, the term has been defined inconsistently, and several studies have indicated that patients with a particular pattern of BCG failure have a worse prognosis. There are many different treatment options for patients who experience BCG failure. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the different current definitions of BCG failure and the present treatment options available for patients with high-risk NMIBC who experience BCG failure. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, the failure rate in response to BCG is about 40-50%. Most guidelines recommend that patients failing BCG should be offered radical cystectomy (RC). The significant potential for progression specific to high-risk NMIBC leads some clinicians to argue that immediate RC should be considered the preferred first-line treatment in high-risk patients, bearing in mind that it achieves a long-term survival rate in excess of 90% with ongoing improvements in morbidity. While other salvage intravesical treatments have to be considered oncologically inferior to RC, several therapies are now available if the patient is unfit to undergo RC or if bladder preservation is the objective, and some agents have shown promise in the context of BCG failure. CONCLUSIONS: The definition, prediction, and treatment of BCG failure remain topics of debate. Patients with BCG failure need carefully selected, individualized therapy in experienced hands. Stratification of patients with BCG failure into groups can identify those with a better or worse prognosis. RC should be the selected option if a patient experiences BCG failure, but several promising intravesical salvage options are available for those cases in which the patient is unfit for surgery or bladder preservation is preferred. Currently data are still inadequate to allow formulation of definitive recommendations, and larger and higher quality studies of salvage intravesical therapies are urgently required.PMID: 27617319Title: Preperitoneal placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir for postoperative erectile dysfunction after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder.Authors: Kim JK, Cho MC, Ku JH, Paick JSSource: Investig Clin Urol. 2016 Sep;57(5):364-6. doi: 10.4111/icu.2016.57.5.364. Epub 2016 Aug 9.Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe a case of safe placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir for postoperative erectile dysfunction (ED) with a history of radical cystoprostatectomy with an orthotopic Studer neobladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 55-year-old bladder cancer patient, who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic Studer neobladder 2 years prior, suffered from postoperative ED. A 3-piece inflatable penile prosthesis was implanted via a penoscrotal incision. The alternative reservoir placement began with a longitudinal 4-cm incision, which was 2 finger-breaths to the left and lateral to the umbilicus. Thereafter, the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths were dissected and incised. Then, the transversalis fascia entering into the preperitoneal space was incised, followed by circumferential sweeping using the forefinger, and, finally, placement of a 100 mL 'flat' reservoir. The reservoir was filled with 65 mL saline and then evaluated for back pressure. The reservoir tubing exited through the defect of the rectus sheaths and tunneled through the abdominal fat into the penoscrotal wound. RESULTS: Total operative time was 105 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 1 and experienced no perioperative complications. At the 6-month follow-up, there was no abdominal bulging from the preperitoneal reservoir, and the reservoir was not palpable. CONCLUSIONS: The preperitoneal placement of the flat reservoir at the level of the umbilicus is a safe and acceptable surgical technique for postoperative ED after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder.PMID: 27617310Title: Liquid biopsy?

The large toad Rhinella marina is common in the cleared tropical forests of the Iquitos region and is regarded as poisonous. The venom from two different populations of R. marina was collected in the Departamento de Loreto, Peru. The samples were assessed for antiproliferative effect and composition. Some 29 compounds were identified or tentatively identified from the venom by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. The main free bufadienolide was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main bufadienolide argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 mug/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 mug/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 mug/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 mug/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 mug/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). This is the first report on the composition of R. marina venom from the Peruvian Amazon pointing out the need to include different venom samples to get a better picture from the activity and composition of South American toad defense substances.PMID: 27615514Title: Proximity labeling reveals molecular determinants of FGFR4 endosomal transport.Authors: Haugsten EM, Sorensen V, Bosakova MK, de Souza GA, Krejci P, Wiedlocha A, Wesche JSource: J Proteome Res. 2016 Sep 11.Abstract: The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are important oncogenes promoting tumor progression in many types of cancer, such as breast, bladder, and lung cancer as well as multiple myeloma and rhabdomyosarcoma. However, little is known about how these receptors are internalized and down-regulated in cells. We have here applied proximity biotin labeling to identify proteins involved in FGFR4 signaling and trafficking. For this purpose we fused a mutated biotin ligase, BirA*, to the C-terminal tail of FGFR4 (FGFR4-BirA*) and the fusion protein was stably expressed in U2OS cells. Upon addition of biotin to these cells, proteins in proximity to the FGFR4-BirA* fusion protein became biotinylated and could be isolated and identified by quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified in total 291 proteins, including 80 proteins that were enriched in samples where the receptor was activated by the ligand (FGF1), among them several proteins previously found to be involved in FGFR signaling (e.g. FRS2, PLC, RSK2 and NCK2). Interestingly, many of the identified proteins were implicated in endosomal transport and by precise annotation we were able to trace the intracellular pathways of activated FGFR4. Validating the data by confocal and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy analysis, we concluded that FGFR4 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis for internalization and is further sorted from early endosomes to the recycling compartment and the trans-Golgi network. Depletion of cells for clathrin heavy chain led to accumulation of FGFR4 at the cell surface and increased levels of active FGFR4 and PLCgamma, while AKT and ERK signaling was diminished, demonstrating that functional clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for proper FGFR4 signaling. Thus, this study reveals proteins and pathways involved in FGFR4 transport and signaling that provide possible targets and opportunities for therapeutic intervention in FGFR4 aberrant cancer.PMID: 27614515Title: [Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy].Authors: Ramiandrisoa F, Duverge L, Castelli J, Nguyen TD, Servagi-Vernat S, de Crevoisier RSource: Cancer Radiother. 2016 Sep 7. pii: S1278-3218(16)30374-2. doi: 10.1016/j.canrad.2016.07.095.Abstract: The knowledge of inter- and intrafraction motion and deformations of the intrapelvic target volumes (prostate, seminal vesicles, prostatectomy bed and lymph nodes) as well as the main organs at risk (bladder and rectum) allow to define rational clinical to planning target volume margins, depending on the different radiotherapy techniques and their uncertainties. In case of image-guided radiotherapy, prostate margins and seminal vesicles margins can be between 5 and 10mm. The margins around the prostatectomy bed vary from 10 to 15mm and those around the lymph node clinical target volume between 7 and 10mm. Stereotactic body radiotherapy allows lower margins, which are 3 to 5mm around the prostate. Image-guided and stereotactic body radiotherapy with adequate margins allow finally moderate or extreme hypofractionation.PMID: 27614395Title: Development and Validation of a Novel Recurrence Risk Stratification for Initial Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer in Asia.Authors: Ieda T, Muto S, Shimizu F, Taguri M, Yanada S, Kitamura K, Terai K, Saito K, Ogishima T, Nagata M, Ide H, Okegawa T, Wakumoto Y, Sakamoto Y, Tsujimura A, Yamaguchi R, Nutahara K, Horie SSource: EBioMedicine. 2016 Sep 2. pii: S2352-3964(16)30405-4. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.051.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some risk classifications to determine prognosis of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have disadvantages in the clinical setting. We investigated whether the EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) risk stratification is useful to predict recurrence and progression in Japanese patients with NMIBC. In addition, we developed and validated a novel, and simple risk classification of recurrence. METHODS: The analysis was based on 1085 patients with NMIBC at six hospitals. Excluding recurrent cases, we included 856 patients with initial NMIBC for the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test were used to calculate recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate according to the EORTC risk classifications. We developed a novel risk classification system for recurrence in NMIBC patients using the independent recurrence prognostic factors based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. External validation was done on an external data set of 641 patients from Kyorin University Hospital. FINDINGS: There were no significant differences in RFS and PFS rates between the groups according to EORTC risk classification. We constructed a novel risk model predicting recurrence that classified patients into three groups using four independent prognostic factors to predict tumour recurrence based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. According to the novel recurrence risk classification, there was a significant difference in 5-year RFS rate between the low (68.4%), intermediate (45.8%) and high (33.7%) risk groups (P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: As the EORTC risk group stratification may not be applicable to Asian patients with NMIBC, our novel classification model can be a simple and useful prognostic tool to stratify recurrence risk in patients with NMIBC.

Prior work suggests that one-third of readmitted patients are readmitted to a different hospital than where the surgery was performed. The impact of this location of readmission needs to be more thoroughly understood. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare patients with bladder, esophagus, lung, or pancreas cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 who underwent extirpative surgery and were readmitted within 90 days. Readmission location was classified as 'index' if readmission was at the hospital where surgery was performed, or 'different' if readmission was elsewhere. Outcomes including complications, reoperations, in-hospital mortality, 90-day mortality, and 90-day total costs were compared based on the location of readmission using a propensity score inverse probability treatment weight analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 7903 (28 %) patients were readmitted within 90 days of index hospitalization. Thirty-three percent were readmitted to a different hospital (bladder 30 %, esophagus 34 %, lung 34 %, pancreas 34 %). Ninety-day mortality and total costs of care were not significantly different between the readmission location groups (all p > 0.05); however, substantial differences in the types of patients, and timing of and reasons for readmission were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients readmitted to different hospitals after major cancer surgery are a different group of patients than those readmitted to the index hospital. Accounting for this, we did not find significant differences in short-term clinical outcomes or costs of care based on readmission location; however, differences in long-term outcomes were observed that should be further explored in future studies.PMID: 27613302Title: [Tumorigenesis from a pathological perspective : Tumor spread and epigenetically regulated genes in bladder cancer].Authors: Gaisa NTSource: Pathologe. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: The article describes the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer from a pathological perspective in three dimensions: morphology, genetics and epigenetics. Field cancerization and tumor cell migration/seeding are the two main hypotheses used for explaining synchronous and metachronous tumors in the urinary tract. By detailed histological mapping of completely embedded cystectomy specimens we found a single tumor focus in nearly 2/3 of the bladders accompanied by surrounding preinvasive carcinoma in situ. We substantiated our findings by studies analyzing TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity in various tumor sites. Identical TP53 mutations suggested a clonal relationship of the tumor foci. In situ lineage tracing via cytochrome C oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme histochemistry and subsequent mitochondrial DNA mutation analysis for definitive evidence of a clonal relationship in bladder tumors remained inconclusive. We found indications for both theories but intraurothelial migration/seeding was more prominent.A further mechanism in tumorigenesis is gene inactivation by epigenetic DNA methylation. We analyzed DNA methylation of various genes, which had previously been found by RNA expression analysis to be downregulated in bladder cancer. Most importantly, epigenetically silenced ITIH5 was associated with early relapse in pT1 high grade tumors and functionally showed an enhanced invasive metastatic phenotype in tumor cells, suggesting a putative tumor suppressive role. Thus, epigenetic gene silencing is an additional mechanism of tumorigenesis especially in tumor progression.PMID: 27612592Title: Meta-Analysis of the Luminal and Basal Subtypes of Bladder Cancer and the Identification of Signature Immunohistochemical Markers for Clinical Use.Authors: Dadhania V, Zhang M, Zhang L, Bondaruk J, Majewski T, Siefker-Radtke A, Guo CC, Dinney C, Cogdell DE, Zhang S, Lee S, Lee JG, Weinstein JN, Baggerly K, McConkey D, Czerniak BSource: EBioMedicine. 2016 Aug 25. pii: S2352-3964(16)30391-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.036.Abstract: BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bladder cancer can be divided into two molecular subtypes referred to as luminal and basal with distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy. We aimed to validate these subtypes in several clinical cohorts and identify signature immunohistochemical markers that would permit simple and cost-effective classification of the disease in primary care centers. METHODS: We analyzed genomic expression profiles of bladder cancer in three cohorts of fresh frozen tumor samples: MD Anderson (n=132), Lund (n=308), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=408) to validate the expression signatures of luminal and basal subtypes and relate them to clinical follow-up data. We also used an MD Anderson cohort of archival bladder tumor samples (n=89) and a parallel tissue microarray to identify immunohistochemical markers that permitted the molecular classification of bladder cancer. FINDINGS: Bladder cancers could be assigned to two candidate intrinsic molecular subtypes referred to here as luminal and basal in all of the datasets analyzed. Luminal tumors were characterized by the expression signature similar to the intermediate/superficial layers of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of PPARgamma target genes and the enrichment for FGFR3, ELF3, CDKN1A, and TSC1 mutations. In addition, luminal tumors were characterized by the overexpression of E-Cadherin, HER2/3, Rab-25, and Src. Basal tumors showed the expression signature similar to the basal layer of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of p63 target genes, the enrichment for TP53 and RB1 mutations, and overexpression of CD49, Cyclin B1, and EGFR. Survival analyses showed that the muscle-invasive basal bladder cancers were more aggressive when compared to luminal cancers. The immunohistochemical expressions of only two markers, luminal (GATA3) and basal (KRT5/6), were sufficient to identify the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer with over 90% accuracy. INTERPRETATION: The molecular subtypes of bladder cancer have distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy, and a simple two-marker immunohistochemical classifier can be used for prognostic and therapeutic stratification.

We focused on the patterns related to the most frequent cancers. METHODS: We analyzed Swiss mortality data over a 39-year period (1969-2007), using a statistical approach applicable to unique daabases, i.e. when no linkage with morbidity databases or disease registries is possible. It was based on a case-control design with bootstrapping to derive standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The cases were defined by the cancer-PD or cancer-MS co-registrations, whereas the controls were drawn from the remaining records with cancer deaths (matching criteria: sex, age, language region of Switzerland, subperiods 1969-1981, 1982-1994, 1995-2007). RESULTS: For PD we found lower SMRs in lung and liver cancer and higher SMRs in melanoma/skin cancer, and in cancers of breast and prostate. As for MS, the SMR in lung cancer was lower than expected, whereas SMRs in colorectal, breast and bladder cancer were higher. CONCLUSIONS: A common pattern of associations can be observed in PD and MS, with a lower risk of lung cancer and higher risk of breast cancer than expected. Thus, PD and MS resemble other conditions with similar (schizophrenia) or reversed patterns (rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation).PMID: 27611951Title: Aberrant expression of KPNA2 is associated with a poor prognosis and contributes to OCT4 nuclear transportation in bladder cancer.Authors: Zhou J, Dong D, Cheng R, Wang Y, Jiang S, Zhu Y, Fan L, Mao X, Gui Y, Li Z, Li X, Shi BSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 7. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11889.Abstract: Recent studies show that Karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) is up-regulated in quite a number of cancers and associated with poor prognosis. Here, we found that expression levels of KPNA2 and OCT4 are up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and significantly associated with primary tumor stage and bladder cancer patients' poorer prognosis. Our data also showed decreased cell proliferation and migration rates of bladder cancer cell lines when the expression of KPNA2 and OCT4 was silenced. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis rate was increased. Furthermore, Co-IP and immunofluorescence assay showed the KPNA2 interacts with OCT4 and inhibits OCT4 nuclear transportation when KPNA2 was silenced. Thus, we confirmed that up-regulated KPNA2 and OCT4 expression is a common feature of bladder cancer that is correlated with increased aggressive tumor behavior. Also, we propose that KPNA2 regulates the process of OCT4 nuclear transportation in bladder cancer.PMID: 27611947Title: Detection of multiple mutations in urinary exfoliated cells from male bladder cancer patients at diagnosis and during follow-up.Authors: Critelli R, Fasanelli F, Oderda M, Polidoro S, Assumma MB, Viberti C, Preto M, Gontero P, Cucchiarale G, Lurkin I, Zwarthoff EC, Vineis P, Sacerdote C, Matullo G, Naccarati ASource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 7. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11883.Abstract: Most bladder cancer (BC) patients need life-long, invasive and expensive monitoring and treatment, making it a serious burden on the health system. Thus, there is a pressing need for an accurate test to assist diagnosis and surveillance of BC as an alternative to cystoscopy. Mutations in human TERT, FGFR3, PIK3CA, and RAS genes have been proposed as potential molecular markers in bladder tumor. Their concomitant presence in urine samples has not been fully explored.We investigated a panel of mutations in DNA from exfoliated urinary cells of 255 BC patients at diagnosis. Forty-one mutations in TERT, FGFR3, PIK3CA, and RAS were analyzed by SNaPshot assay in relation to clinical outcome. In 81 of these patients under surveillance, the same set of mutations was screened in additional 324 samples prospectively collected.The most common mutations detected in urine at diagnosis were in the TERT promoter. In non-invasive BC, these mutations were related to high risk and grade (p<0.0001) as well as progression to muscle-invasive disease (p=0.01), whereas FGFR3 mutations were observed in low-grade BC (p=0.02) and patients with recurrences (p=0.05). Stronger associations were observed for combined TERT and FGFR3 mutations and number of recurrences (OR: 4.54 95% CI: 1.23-16.79, p=0.02). Analyses of the area under the curve for combinations of mutations detected at diagnosis and follow-up showed an accuracy of prediction of recurrence of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89).Mutations in urine of BC patients may represent reliable biomarkers. In particular, TERT and FGFR3 mutations have a good accuracy of recurrence prediction.PMID: 27611853Title: Dosimetric Comparison between Three-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided and Conventional Two-Dimensional Point A-Based Intracavitary Brachytherapy Planning for Cervical Cancer.Authors: Ren J, Yuan W, Wang R, Wang Q, Li Y, Xue C, Yan Y, Ma X, Tan L, Liu ZSource: PLoS One. 2016 Sep 9;11(9):e0161932. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161932. eCollection 2016.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively compare the 3-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided and conventional 2-dimensional (2D) point A-based intracavitary brachytherapy (BT) planning for cervical cancer with regard to target dose coverage and dosages to adjacent organs-at risk (OARs). METHODS: A total of 79 patients with cervical cancer were enrolled to receive 2D point A-based BT planning and then immediately to receive 3D planning between October 2011 and April 2013 at the First Hospital Affiliated to Xi'an Jiao Tong University (Xi'an, China). The dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters for gross tumor volume (GTV), high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), intermediate-risk clinical target volume (IR-CTV) and OARs were compared between the 2D and 3D planning. RESULTS: In small tumors, there was no significant difference in most of the DVHs between 2D and 3D planning (all p>0.05). While in big tumors, 3D BT planning significantly increased the DVHs for most of the GTV, HR-CTV and IR-CTV, and some OARs compared with 2D planning (all P<0.05). In 3D planning, DVHs for GTV, HR-CTV, IR-CTV and some OARs were significantly higher in big tumors than in small tumors (all p<0.05). In contrast, in 2D planning, DVHs for almost all of the HR-CTV and IR-CTV were significantly lower in big tumors (all p<0.05). In eccentric tumors, 3D planning significantly increased dose coverage but decreased dosages to OARs compared with 2D planning (p<0.05). In tumors invading adjacent tissues, the target dose coverage in 3D planning was generally significantly higher than in 2D planning (P<0.05); the dosages to the adjacent rectum and bladder were significantly higher but those to sigmoid colon were lower in 3D planning (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 3D MRI image-guided BT planning exhibits advantages over 2D planning in a complex way, generally showing advantages for the treatment of cervical cancer except small tumors.PMID: 27611622Title: Diagnostic accuracy of CT urography and visual assessment during ureterorenoscopy in upper tract urothelial carcinoma.Authors: Grahn A, Melle-Hannah M, Malm C, Jaderling F, Radecka E, Beckman M, Brehmer MSource: BJU Int. 2016 Sep 9. doi: 10.1111/bju.13652.Abstract: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare condition, although the annual incidence is increasing, possibly as a result of improved diagnostic performance and higher survival rates in patients with bladder cancer. Research data and technical development achieved in the last decades have led to a shift in the guidelines of European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urological Association for diagnosis and treatment of UTUC. Computed tomography urography (CTU) has become the imaging of choice for investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: We assessed the associations between sleep duration and incidences of total and 18 site-specific cancers in the NIH-AARP Health and Diet Study cohort, with 173,327 men and 123,858 women aged 51-72 years at baseline. Self-reported sleep duration categories were assessed via questionnaire. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using 7-8 hours/night as the reference. RESULTS: We observed a significantly increased risk of stomach cancer among male short sleepers (multivariable HR5-6 vs. 7-8 hours = 1.29; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.59; Ptrend = 0.03). We also observed suggestive associations in either short or long sleepers, which did not reach overall significance (Ptrend >0.05), including increased risks in male short sleepers for cancers of head and neck (HR<5vs.7-8 hours = 1.39; 95%CI:1.00-1.95), bladder (HR5-6vs.7-8 hours = 1.10; 95%CI:1.00-1.20), thyroid (HR<5 vs. 7-8 hours = 2.30; 95%CI:1.06, 5.02), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) (HR5-6vs.7-8 hours = 1.17; 95%CI:1.02-1.33), and myeloma (HR<5vs.7-8 hours = 2.06; 95%CI:1.20-3.51). In women, the suggestive associations include a decreased total cancer risk (HR<5vs.7-8 hours = 0.9; 95%CI:0.83-0.99) and breast cancer risk (HR<5vs.7-8 hours = 0.84; 95%CI:0.71-0.98) among short sleepers. A decreased ovarian cancer risk (HR>/= 9 vs. 7-8 hours = 0.50; 95%CI:0.26-0.97) and an increased NHL risk (HR>/= 9 vs. 7-8 hours = 1.45; 95%CI:1.00-2.11) were observed among long sleepers. CONCLUSION: In an older population, we observed an increased stomach cancer risk in male short sleepers and suggestive associations with short or long sleep duration for many cancer risks in both genders.PMID: 27609792Title: Impact of Fluciclovine (18F) Positron Emission Tomography on Target Volume Definition for Post-Prostatectomy Salvage Radiotherapy: Initial Findings from a Randomized Trial.Authors: Jani A, Schreibmann E, Rossi PJ, Shelton JW, Godette K, Nieh P, Master VA, Kucuk O, Goodman M, Halkar R, Cooper S, Chen Z, Schuster DMSource: J Nucl Med. 2016 Sep 8. pii: jnumed.116.176057.Abstract: The purpose was to evaluate the role of the synthetic amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer fluciclovine (18F) in modifying the clinical and planning target volume (CTV and PTV) definition in post-prostatectomy patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy and to evaluate the resulting dosimetric consequences to surrounding organs at risk. METHODS: 96 patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective intention to treat clinical trial for potential salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy. All patients underwent initial treatment planning based on results from conventional abdominopelvic imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Patients in the experimental arm(n = 45) underwent planning modification after additionally undergoing abdominopelvic fluciclovine (18F) PET/CT. For each patient, the target volume (CTV{prostate bed}[or CTV1{pelvis}/CTV2{prostate bed}] and PTV[or PTV1/PTV2]) that would have been treated prior to fluciclovine (18F) registration (PRE) was compared to that after registration (POST). The V40Gy and V65Gy of the organs at risk (Rectum, Bladder[minus CTV], and Penile Bulb) PRE and POST were compared. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired t-test. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were compared between the control and experimental groups using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Radiotherapy was planned either to the prostate fossa alone (CTV)[64.8-66.6 Gy][n = 24] or pelvis (CTV1)[45.0 Gy] followed by prostate fossa boost (CTV2)[19.8-25.2 Gy][n = 21]. In each case, the corresponding PTV expansion was 0.8 cm(0.6 cm posterior). For CTV, CTV1, CTV2, PTV, and PTV1, POST volumes were all significantly larger than the corresponding PRE volumes (only PTV2 PRE vs POST volumes were not significantly different). Analysis of Rectum, Bladder[minus CTV], and Penile Bulb V40Gy and V60Gy PRE vs POST demonstrated that only Penile Bulb endpoints were significantly higher after registration. No significant differences in acute GU or GI toxicity were observed. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of fluciclovine (18F) PET information into the treatment planning process leads to significant differences in target definition with higher doses to the penile bulb but with no significant differences in bladder or rectal dose or acute GU/GI toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the impact of fluciclovine (18F) on cancer control and late toxicity endpoints.PMID: 27609788Title: Safety, dosimetry and tumor detection ability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 - a novel radioligand for uPAR PET imaging: first-in-humans study.Authors: Skovgaard D, Persson M, Brandt-Larsen M, Christensen C, Madsen J, Klausen TL, Holm S, Andersen FL, Loft A, Berthelsen AK, Pappot H, Brasso K, Kroman N, Hoejgaard L, Kjaer ASource: J Nucl Med. 2016 Sep 8. pii: jnumed.116.178970.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Overexpression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (uPAR) represents an established biomarker for aggressiveness in most common malignant diseases, including breast (BC), prostate (PC) and urinary bladder cancer (UBC) and is therefore an important target for new cancer therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. In the study, uPAR Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging using a 68Ga-labelled version of the uPAR targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC and UBC. The aim of this first-in-humans, Phase I, clinical trial was to investigate safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. METHODS: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 (154 + 59 MBq; range 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial PET/CT scans (10 minutes, 1 and 2 hours p.i.). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 and Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest (VOIs) in the malignant tissue. RESULTS: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when using the clinical target dose of 200 MBq. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases. CONCLUSION: This first-in-humans, Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrates the safe use and clinical potential of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 as a new radioligand for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.PMID: 27609194Title: Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in the management of high-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Keehn A, Gartrell B, Schoenberg MPSource: Future Oncol. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: Unlike other malignancies, the death rate of bladder cancer has not declined in several decades, highlighting the need for new treatment options. In the emerging era of immunotherapy, therapeutic cancer vaccines are an attractive option to cure, control and prevent cancer. Despite this, finding a feasible and efficacious vaccine platform has proven elusive across all malignancies. Vesigenurtacel-L is the first whole cell, allogeneic vaccine intended to treat high-grade, nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. This type of vaccine technology for bladder cancer is novel, and has the potential to be both economically and logistically feasible.PMID: 27607746Title: Factors Related to Adaptation to Cystectomy With Urinary Diversion: An Integrative Review.Authors: Merandy KSource: J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs. 2016 Sep-Oct;43(5):499-508. doi: 10.1097/WON.0000000000000269.Abstract: Patients with bladder (urothelial) cancer undergoing urinary diversion (UD) experience physical changes that require important adjustments in their daily lives. This integrative review aims to identify factors that influence adult adaptation to life after cystectomy with the creation of a UD. A review of primary research articles published between 1990 and 2014 was conducted using the PubMed and CINAHL Plus electronic databases. Results of the studies were summarized into 5 categories: (1) individual and family factors, (2) technical aspects related to the individual's ability to care for his or her UD, (3) perioperative nursing care, (4) educational needs, and (5) symptom experience. Bladder cancer patients treated with a cystectomy with a UD have a complex set of needs during postoperative adaptation to their reconstructed urinary system. This integrative review summarizes existing knowledge of factors that affect adaptation to a UD in patients with bladder cancer and may guide future studies. Research on this is limited and more studies are needed.PMID: 27607180Title: Unexpected Detection of Urinary Bladder Cancer on Dual Phase 18F-NaF PET/CT in a Patient With Back Pain.Authors: Shao F, Zou Y, Cai L, Wang X, Chen YSource: Clin Nucl Med. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: A 72-year-old man underwent F-NaF PET/CT to evaluate causes of lower back pain. The PET images revealed multiple foci of increased activity in several vertebral bodies, which might account for the patient's symptoms. In addition, the CT image revealed partially calcified soft tissue mass in the posterior wall of the urinary bladder, which was photopenic relative to the radioactive urine on early PET images but became intense on delayed PET images. The diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made pathologically after a transurethral resection of the mass.PMID: 27605469Title: Orthotopic mouse model of renal pelvic cancer using a human bladder cancer cell line.Authors: Miyake M, Hori S, Morizawa Y, Tatsumi Y, Nakai Y, Fujimoto KSource: Int J Urol. 2016 Sep 7. doi: 10.1111/iju.13220.Abstract: ?PMID: 27605411Title: Use of sigmoid colon in orthotopic neobladder reconstruction: Long-term results.Authors: Nicita G, Martini A, Filocamo MT, Saieva C, Tosto A, Stomaci N, Bigazzi B, Villari DSource: Int J Urol. 2016 Sep 7. doi: 10.1111/iju.13201.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To present our experience with a sigmoid orthotopic neobladder. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the functional and oncological outcomes of 160 patients who underwent orthotopic neobladder reconstruction using a detubularized 20-25-cm sigmoid segment at our institution. Each patient was evaluated every 3 months the first year, every 6 months for the next 4 years and annually thereafter. Urodynamic studies of all consenting patients were carried out after 6 months, and 2, 5 and 10 years. We carried out the log-rank test, and used Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The anova test was used to compare urodynamic findings over time. RESULTS: Mean follow up was 6.8 years (range 0.65-21.7 years). Overall survival was 58.1% at 5 years, and 47.1% at 10 years. Early complications occurred in 36 patients (22.6%); late complications in 40 (25%). Stage V chronic kidney disease developed in two patients (1.3%). Complete (daytime and night-time) continence, defined as no need for pads or condom devices, was achieved by 45% of patients at 5 years, daytime continence was achieved by just 36% of patients; both were unchanged at 10 years. A significant difference emerged in maximal neobladder capacity and post-void residual values between 6 months and 2 years, and between 2 and 5 years (P < 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sigmoid neobladder continence and capacity significantly improve over the first 5 years, and they remain stable over the long term. Upper urinary tract function is not affected by endoluminal pressure, and the rate of metabolic imbalance is negligible.PMID: 27604705Title: [Modern networks : Topics in the working group "Bladder cancer research" of the GeSRU Academics].Authors: Hofbauer S, Kalogirou C, Roghmann F, Seitz AK, Vallo S, Wezel F, Worst T, Nawroth RSource: Urologe A. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: In January 2015, the research group "bladder cancer research" was founded as part of the GeSRU Academics research initiative. A general challenge to work successfully in a novel network structure is to identify common scientific topics and technical expertise in the group. Thus, one of the first tasks was to learn about current research projects from members within the group in order to address a project that suits the group's expertise. The following review summarizes three different directions that are key projects in Urologic Departments at German Universities that will be the basis to start fruitful collaborations.PMID: 27604375Title: Epidemiology, diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and prognostic assessment of upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).Authors: Soria F, Shariat SF, Lerner SP, Fritsche HM, Rink M, Kassouf W, Spiess PE, Lotan Y, Ye D, Fernandez MI, Kikuchi E, Chade DC, Babjuk M, Grollman AP, Thalmann GNSource: World J Urol. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: PURPOSE: Upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively uncommon disease with limited available evidence on specific topics. The purpose of this article was to review the previous literature to summarize the current knowledge about UTUC epidemiology, diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and prognostic assessment. METHODS: Using MEDLINE, a non-systematic review was performed including articles between January 2000 and February 2016. English language original articles, reviews and editorials were selected based on their clinical relevance. RESULTS: UTUC accounts for 5-10 % of all urothelial cancers, with an increasing incidence. UTUC and bladder cancer share some common risk factors, even if they are two different entities regarding practical, biological and clinical characteristics. Aristolochic acid plays an important role in UTUC pathogenesis in certain regions. It is further estimated that approximately 10 % of UTUC are part of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer spectrum disease. UTUC diagnosis remains mainly based on imaging and endoscopy, but development of new technologies is rapidly changing the diagnosis algorithm. To help the decision-making process regarding surgical treatment, extent of lymphadenectomy and selection of neoadjuvant systemic therapies, predictive tools based on preoperative patient and tumor characteristics have been developed. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and prognostic assessment changes is essential to correctly diagnose and manage UTUC patients, thereby potentially improving their outcomes.PMID: 27604374Title: Results of a prospective randomized study assessing the efficacy of fluorescent cystoscopy-assisted transurethral resection and single instillation of doxorubicin in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Rolevich AI, Zhegalik AG, Mokhort AA, Minich AA, Vasilevich VY, Polyakov SL, Krasny SA, Sukonko OGSource: World J Urol. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of two treatment options for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC): (1) transurethral resection (TUR) guided by fluorescence cystoscopy (FC) with the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and (2) single early instillation of doxorubicin in a single-center open-label prospective randomized study with a 2 x 2 factorial design. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical suspicion of primary or recurrent NMIBC were randomized into four study arms: FC-assisted TUR with 5-ALA and single instillation of doxorubicin, FC-assisted TUR without instillation, TUR in white light (WL) with single instillation of doxorubicin, and WL-TUR only. The study was designed to assess recurrence-free survival in arms with and without any of two interventions. RESULTS: Of 525 patients included, 377 (72 %) were eligible for primary outcome assessment. The median follow-up was 54.8 months. FC statistically significantly decreased the risk of disease recurrence and progression with hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 (95 % CI 0.39-0.80, p = 0.001) and 0.33 (95 % CI 0.12-0.91, p = 0.031), respectively. The HRs for recurrence and progression for single instillation of doxorubicin were 0.76 (95 % CI 0.54-1.07, p = 0.11) and 0.65 (95 % CI 0.28-1.52, p = 0.32), respectively. The overall and cancer-specific survival rates did not differ significantly based on the therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NMIBC, FC-assisted TUR with 5-ALA results in a substantial recurrence and progression risk reduction as compared to WL-TUR. The single early postoperative instillation of doxorubicin did not have a statistically significant impact on recurrence and progression risks.PMID: 27602771Title: Single-cell analyses of transcriptional heterogeneity in squamous cell carcinoma of urinary bladder.Authors: Zhang X, Zhang M, Hou Y, Xu L, Li W, Zou Z, Liu C, Xu A, Wu SSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11803.Abstract: Cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity within a single tumor is a common phenotype among various cancer types including squamous cell carcinoma. To further study the fundamentals and importance of heterogeneity of cell functions and its potential mechanisms, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on human squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (SCCB) and its corresponding physiologically normal epithelia. Extensive differentially expressed genes were uncovered by comparing cancer and normal single cells, which were preferentially enriched in cancer-correlated pathways, such as p53 signaling and bladder cancer pathway. Furthermore, the most diversely expressed genes were particularly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway, such as CACNG4, CACNA1E and CACNA1H, which involve in cancer evolution and heterogeneity formation. Co-expression network and hub-gene analyses revealed several remarkable "hub genes" of each regulatory module. Some of them are cancer related, such as POU2F3, NKD1 and CYP2C8, while LINC00189, GCC2 and OR9Q1 genes are rarely reported in human diseases. The genes within an interesting module are highly correlated with others, which could be treated as potential targets for SCCB patients. Our findings have fundamental implications for SCCB biology and therapeutic strategies.PMID: 27602581Title: Computational identification of microRNAs associated to both epithelial to mesenchymal transition and NGAL/MMP-9 pathways in bladder cancer.Authors: Falzone L, Candido S, Salemi R, Basile MS, Scalisi A, McCubrey JA, Torino F, Signorelli SS, Montella M, Libra MSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11805.Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the leading cancer of the urinary tract. It is often diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease. To date, no specific and effective early detection biomarkers are available. Cancer development and progression are associated with the involvement of both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor microenvironment of which NGAL/MMP-9 complex represents the main player in bladder cancer. It is known that change in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression may result in gene modulation. Therefore, the identification of specific miRNAs associated with EMT pathway and NGAL/MMP-9 complex may be useful to detect the development of bladder cancer at early stages.On this ground, the expression levels of miRNAs in public available datasets of bladder cancer containing data of non-coding RNA profiling was evaluated. This analysis revealed a group of 16 miRNAs differentially expressed between bladder cancer patients and related healthy controls. By miRNA prediction tool (mirDIP), the relationship between the identified miRNAs and the EMT genes was established. Using the DIANA-mirPath (v.2) software, miRNAs, able to modulate the expression of NGAL and MMP-9 genes, were recognized.The results of this study provide evidence that the downregulated hsa-miR-145-5p and hsa-miR-214-3p may modulate the expression of both EMT and NGAL/MMP-9 pathways. Therefore, further validation analyses may confirm the usefulness of these selected miRNAs for predicting the development of bladder cancer at the early stage of the disease.PMID: 27602330Title: The Comparison of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer by NCCN Risk Groups.Authors: Ricco A, Manahan G, Lanciano R, Hanlon A, Yang J, Arrigo S, Lamond J, Feng J, Mooreville M, Garber B, Brady LSource: Front Oncol. 2016 Aug 23;6:184. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00184. eCollection 2016.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to compare freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) between stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with organ confined prostate cancer treated between 2007 through 2012 utilizing the 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk stratification guidelines. A secondary objective is to compare our updated toxicity at last follow-up compared with pretreatment with respect to bowel, bladder, sexual functioning, and need for invasive procedures between the two groups. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 270 consecutive men treated with either SBRT (n = 150) or IMRT (n = 120) at a community hospital with two distinct radiation departments and referral patterns. Charts were reviewed for pretreatment and treatment factors including race, age, clinical T stage, initial PSA, Gleason score, use of androgen deprivation therapy, treatment with SBRT vs. IMRT, as well as stratification by 2015 NCCN guidelines. Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology was used to estimate FFBF, with statistical comparisons accomplished using log rank tests. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to establish independent factors prognostic of biochemical failure. Descriptive statistics were used to describe toxicity graded by a modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late radiation morbidity scoring system. RESULTS: Significant prognostic factors in univariate analysis for FFBF included NCCN risk groups (p = 0.0032), grade (p = 0.019), and PSA (p = 0.008). There was no significant difference in FFBF between SBRT vs. IMRT (p = 0.46) with 6-year actuarial FFBF of 91.9% for SBRT and 88.9% for IMRT. Multivariable analysis revealed only the NCCN risk stratification to be significant predictor for FFBF (p = 0.04). Four-year actuarial FFBF by NCCN risk stratification was 100% very low risk, 100% low risk, 96.5% intermediate risk, 94.5% high risk, and 72.7% very high risk. There were no grade 3 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities for either SBRT or IMRT at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: No significant difference in FFBF was found between SBRT and IMRT for organ confined prostate cancer in multivariable analysis within this retrospective data set. Overall toxicity was low. The 2015 NCCN risk stratification was validated in this population and was the only significant factor for FFBF in multivariable analysis.PMID: 27602194Title: Primary Gastric Chorioadenocarcinoma.Authors: Baraka BA, Al Kharusi SS, Al Bahrani BJ, Bhathagar GSource: Oman Med J. 2016 Sep;31(5):381-3. doi: 10.5001/omj.2016.75.Abstract: Primary gastric chorioadenocarcinoma (PGC) is a rare and rapidly invasive tumor. Choriocarcinoma is usually known to be of endometrial origin and gestational; however, it has been reported in other extragenital organs, such as the gall bladder, prostate, lung, liver, and the gastrointestinal tract. Human chorionic gonadotropin related neoplasms of the stomach are seldom discussed in the literature. We report a case of PGC in a 56-year-old man treated with a standard non-gestational choriocarcinoma chemotherapy regimen, EMA/CO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, vincristine), with a complete response and good tolerability.PMID: 27602160Title: Bladder and vaginal transitional cell carcinoma: A case report.Authors: Aoun F, Kourie HR, El Rassy E, van Velthoven RSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):2181-2183. Epub 2016 Jul 20.Abstract: The involvement of the female genital tract in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) has not been fully elucidated in women, although involvement is usually associated with a poor prognosis. The vagina, in particular, is considered to be the most commonly affected gynecological organ, with an incidence of 4% of total TCC cases. The pathogenesis of vaginal TCC is challenging to determine, although it is essential for the adequate management of the tumor and to determine the appropriate treatment. The present study reports a case of bladder TCC and metachronous vaginal TCC. The patient had a history of high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer treated by BCG and presented with a recurrent carcinoma in situ. A novel cycle of BCG was initiated but the patient had a persistent disease and a palpable mass on bimanual examination. Radical anterior pelvectomy and bilateral pelvic and inguinal lymph node dissection was performed revealing the presence of TCC of the bladder neck and the invasion into the anterior vaginal wall. The differences between local vaginal invasion and the metastatic spread from a primary bladder TCC, the occurrence of a second primary vaginal tumor and the direct implantation of TCC via urine that contains transitional cancer cells were reviewed and analyzed. Finally, a management plan was determined.PMID: 27602129Title: Peritoneal bladder fistula following radiotherapy for cervical cancer: A case report.Authors: Shi F, Wang T, Wang J, Hui B, Chai Y, Wang J, Liu ZSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):2008-2010. Epub 2016 Jul 7.Abstract: The occurrence of a peritoneal bladder fistula as a result of radiation cystitis following radiotherapy for cervical cancer is extremely rare and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported previously. The present study reports the case of a 50-year-old woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer 20 years previously and was treated with radiotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with radiation cystitis 10 years ago, which was treated with Chinese medicine, and began experiencing sudden abdominal pain and bowel difficulties following urination 3 years ago. B-ultrasound examination at The People's Hospital of Tongchuan (Tongchuan, China) detected the presence of abdominal pelvic fluid. Following antibiotic (levofloxacin for 5 days) and ascites extraction treatment, symptoms were relieved without recurrence. However, 5 days prior to admission to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiatong University (Xi'an, China) on June 25, 2014, the patient experienced difficulty when urinating, abdominal pain and bloating, but did not experience frequent urination, hematuria or fever. Cystoscopic examination revealed a visible fistula on the bladder wall measuring 1x1 cm in diameter. Cytoscopic examination 1 month after catheterization and ascites extraction revealed no evidence of the fistula. The patient was followed up every 3 months for a year and a half, and is currently alive and well. In conclusion, the occurrence of peritoneal bladder fistula following radiation therapy is rare and cystoscopy is the preferred method of examination and diagnosis. Early detection and treatment may significantly improve the prognosis of patients.PMID: 27602114Title: 4-HPR impairs bladder cancer cell migration and invasion by interfering with the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/MMP-2 signaling pathways.Authors: Cao Y, Wang X, Xu C, Gao Z, Zhou H, Wang Y, Cao R, Liu T, Liu TSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):1833-1839. Epub 2016 Jul 22.Abstract: In order to identify the anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effect of the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) on the human bladder cancer EJ cell line, and to study its impact on the expression of wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family, member 5a (Wnt5a), the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and the migration and invasion of EJ cells, migration and Matrigel invasion assays, as well as western blot analyses, were used in the present study. The results of the migration and Matrigel invasion assays indicated that the inhibitor of JNK SP600125 could inhibit the effect of 4-HPR on EJ cells. The expression of Wnt5a and MMP-2, and the phosphorylation of JNK, were analyzed by western blotting. The data revealed that 4-HPR inhibited the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells through stimulating Wnt5a activation, causing the downregulation of MMP-2 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of JNK in these cells. However, JNK signaling did not appear to have a direct effect on the expression of MMP-2. The present study demonstrated that 4-HPR may be a potent anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent that functions via the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/MMP-2 signaling pathways.PMID: 27602104Title: Epigenetic modification suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion of urothelial cancer cell lines.Authors: Brockmeyer P, Hemmerlein BSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):1693-1700. Epub 2016 Jul 18.Abstract: Epigenetic approaches offer additional therapeutic options, including apoptosis induction, modification of cell cycle regulating proteins and the re-expression of pharmaceutical targets, such as hormone receptors. The present study analyzed the effect of the epigenetic modifiers 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and Trichostatin A on the proliferative, migratory and invasive behavior of four urinary bladder cancer cell lines (RT-4, RT-112, VMCUB-1 and T-24), and the expression of various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays revealed that treatment with the two epigenetic modifiers resulted in proliferation inhibition in all cell lines, and migration and invasion inhibition in RT-4, RT-112 and T-24 cell lines. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the mRNA expression of a broad selection of MMPs and their TIMPs was induced in all cell lines, and MMP-14 mRNA expression was suppressed in all cell lines, with the exception of RT-4. In conclusion, epigenetic modifications suppressed the motility and invasiveness of three out of four urothelial cancer cell lines. The inhibitory effect on cell motility appears to be crucial for reduced invasive properties. However, even a broad spectrum of mRNA analysis does not sufficiently explain the loss of invasiveness, as it does not allow for functional conclusions. Further complex urothelial tumour models should be applied to investigate whether epigenetic therapeutic approaches may be an option in urothelial cancer.PMID: 27601964Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Radiation-induced Hemorrhagic Cystitis.Authors: Zwaans BM, Nicolai HG, Chancellor MB, Lamb LESource: Rev Urol. 2016;18(2):57-65. doi: 10.3909/riu0700.Abstract: As diagnosis and treatment of cancer is improving, medical and social issues related to cancer survivorship are becoming more prevalent. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), a rare but serious disease that may affect patients after pelvic radiation or systemic chemotherapy, has significant unmet medical needs. Although no definitive treatment is currently available, various interventions are employed for HC. Effects of nonsurgical treatments for HC are of modest success and studies aiming to control radiation-induced bladder symptoms are lacking. In this review, we present current and advanced therapeutic strategies for HC to help cancer survivors deal with long-term urologic health issues.PMID: 27601949Title: Reducing radiation-associated toxicity using online image guidance (IGRT) in prostate cancer patients undergoing dose-escalated radiation therapy.Authors: Becker-Schiebe M, Abaci A, Ahmad T, Hoffmann WSource: Rep Pract Oncol Radiother. 2016 May-Jun;21(3):188-94. doi: 10.1016/j.rpor.2016.01.005. Epub 2016 Feb 20.Abstract: AIM: To determine the influence of IGRT in terms of toxicities compared to non-IGRT patients undergoing definitive RT. BACKGROUND: Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) enables immediate correction of target movement by online imaging. For prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT), a geographical miss of the prostate may result in increased dose-volume effects in the rectum and bladder. METHODS: A total of 198 prostate cancer patients treated between 2003 and 2013 were recruited randomly for this evaluation. The rates of genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity for 96 non-IGRT patients (total dose: 72/73.8 Gy) were compared to those for 102 IGRT patients (total dose: 77.4 Gy) according to the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0). Follow-up information included treatment-related symptoms and PSA relapse. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 55.4 months, a statistically significant difference was noted for acute GI toxicities >/=1 in favour of IGRT. Significantly more patients treated by IGRT were free of acute GI symptoms (43% vs. 19%, p = 0.0012). In the non-IGRT group, more patients experienced acute GU side effects (89% vs. 80%, p = 0.07). Late toxicity scores were comparable for both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, we demonstrated that despite dose escalation, IGRT enabled us to reduce the GI side effects of radiation. IGRT can therefore be considered to be the standard of care for dose-escalated RT of localized prostate cancer.PMID: 27601510Title: Public Reporting of Hospital-Level Cancer Surgical Volumes in California: An Opportunity to Inform Decision Making and Improve Quality.Authors: Clarke CA, Asch SM, Baker L, Bilimoria K, Dudley RA, Fong N, Holliday-Hanson ML, Hopkins DS, Imholz EM, Malin J, Moy L, O'Sullivan M, Parker JP, Saigal CS, Spurlock B, Teleki S, Zingmond D, Lang LSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep 6. pii: JOPR010819.Abstract: PURPOSE: Most patients, providers, and payers make decisions about cancer hospitals without any objective data regarding quality or outcomes. We developed two online resources allowing users to search and compare timely data regarding hospital cancer surgery volumes. METHODS: Hospital cancer surgery volumes for all California hospitals were calculated using ICD-9 coded hospital discharge summary data. Cancer surgeries included (bladder, brain, breast, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, and stomach) were selected on the basis of a rigorous literature review to confirm sufficient evidence of a positive association between volume and mortality. The literature could not identify threshold numbers of surgeries associated with better or worse outcomes. A multidisciplinary working group oversaw the project and ensured sound methodology. RESULTS: In California in 2014, about 60% of surgeries were performed at top-quintile-volume hospitals, but the per-hospital median numbers of surgeries for esophageal, pancreatic, stomach, liver, or bladder cancer surgeries were four or fewer. At least 670 patients received cancer surgery at hospitals that performed only one or two surgeries for a particular cancer type; 72% of those patients lived within 50 miles of a top-quintile-volume hospital. CONCLUSION: There is clear potential for more readily available information about hospital volumes to help patient, providers, and payers choose cancer surgery hospitals. Our successful public reporting of hospital volumes in California represents an important first step toward making publicly available even more provider-specific data regarding cancer care quality, costs, and outcomes, so those data can inform decision-making and encourage quality improvement.PMID: 27601364Title: Pelvic Lymph Node Staging by Combined 18F-FDG-PET/CT Imaging in Bladder Cancer Prior to Radical Cystectomy.Authors: Pichler R, De Zordo T, Fritz J, Kroiss A, Aigner F, Heidegger I, Virgolini I, Horninger W, Uprimny CSource: Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2016 Aug 10. pii: S1558-7673(16)30243-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clgc.2016.08.009.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate lymph node (LN) staging in bladder cancer before radical cystectomy is essential as LN metastases have an independent prognostic value. Most studies used a cutoff of > 10 mm in detecting pelvic LN spread. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) alone, or combined for preoperative pelvic LN staging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 70 bladder cancer patients that were staged with 18F-FDG-PET/CT before radical cystectomy between 2012 and 2015. 18F-FDG-PET images were analyzed visually and semi-quantitatively by calculating the maximum standardized uptake value. CT scans were reviewed using different cutoffs of pelvic LNs, with the best cutoff at 8 mm (area under the curve = 0.684). RESULTS: Metastatic LNs were confirmed in 53 (2.8%) of 1906 resected LNs in 11 (15.7%) patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 54.5%, 89.8%, and 84.3% for 18F-FDG-PET alone; 45.5%, 91.5%, and 84.3% for CT (LNs > 8 mm) alone; and 27.3%, 96.6%, and 85.7% for CT (LNs > 10 mm) alone, respectively. Combined 18F-FDG-PET/CT resulted in a nonsignificant increase of diagnostic accuracy using a cutoff > 8 mm for LN evaluation (63.6%, 86.4%, and 82.9%, respectively). A significant improvement of sensitivity to 63.6% was achieved only when LNs > 10 mm were considered suspicious (P = .046), but this reduced specificity to 88.1% (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: Combined 18F-FDG-PET/CT does not seem to be justified in preoperative staging if the threshold of pelvic LNs is set > 8 mm.PMID: 27601277Title: Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition and Its Correlation With Clinicopathologic Features in Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.Authors: Singh R, Ansari JA, Maurya N, Mandhani A, Agrawal V, Garg MSource: Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2016 Aug 9. pii: S1558-7673(16)30224-5. doi: 10.1016/j.clgc.2016.07.021.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process in the pathogenesis of urinary bladder cancer. Despite significant advancements in its diagnosis and treatment, the outcomes have more or less remained the same. In the present study, the expression of EMT markers was investigated to evaluate its prognostic significance in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was undertaken to examine the expression of EMT markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, Twist, Zeb, and Slug, on 28 bladder tumor tissues (15 cases of NMIBC and 13 of MIBC) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to check the protein expression and localization of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, and Slug. RESULTS: At the message level, reduced expression of E-cadherin correlated with gender (P = .004), enhanced expression of N-cadherin correlated with stage and age (P = .02, for both), and increased expression of EMT transcription factors correlated significantly with stage, grade, or age. Inverse correlation of reduced levels of E-cadherin were observed with new expression of N-cadherin (P = .001; Mann-Whitney U test) and vimentin (P = .001; Mann-Whitney U test). On IHC, novel expression of vimentin and N-cadherin was associated with enhanced expression of Snail and Slug (P = .005; Wilcoxon signed rank test). CONCLUSION: Molecular validation of the EMT marker profile proved to be a sensitive and an effective prognostic tool for objective and systematic investigation of EMT function in the pathogenesis of urinary bladder cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are required with a greater number of clinical samples.PMID: 27600610Title: Effect of Combined Treatment of Radiation and Tissue-specific Recombinant Oncolytic Adenovirus on bladder cancer cells.Authors: Zhang H, Wang F, Mao C, Zhang Z, Fu S, Lu J, Zhai Z, Li R, Li S, Rodriguez R, Wang ZSource: Int J Radiat Biol. 2016 Sep 6:1-27.Abstract: Purpose Gene therapy combined with radiation have shown promising potential for treatment of tumor. The paper was aimed to clarify the synergistic effect of radiotherapy combined with the bladder cancer tissue-speci fi c oncolytic adenovirus (Ad-PSCAE-UPII-E1A) on bladder cancer cells and to study the underlying synergy mechanisms of the combined treatment. Materials and Methods Adenovirus carrying E1A under control of UPII promoter and prostate stem cell antigen enhancer (PSCAE) were successfully constructed. The viability of bladder cancer cells BIU-87 and EJ was determined by MTT assay. The apoptotic assay was demonstrated by flow cytometry and TEM. Virus titer was determined by TCID50 assay, and proteins Mre11, chk2-thr68, and E1A were analyzed by westernblot method. Results oncolytic adenovirus combined with radiotherapy improved antitumor efficacy compared with the alone treatment in a time and X-ray dosage-dependent. When adenovirus infection was scheduled at 24 hours after irradiation, cancer cells had the lowest viability. Adenovirus and irradiation induced cell death through the caspase-3 related apoptotic pathway, and bladder cancer cells were arrested at G1 (BIU87) or S phase (EJ). Autophagic vacuoles were observed in bladder cancer cells treated with radiation and adenovirus. After irradiation, more virus particles were observed in the BIU-87 and EJ cells. However, by A TCID50 assay, there was no difference in virus titter between irradiated bladder cancer cells and un-irradiated cells. The proteins Mre11, Chk2-thr68 which involved in the DNA break repair pathway were decreased while gamma-H2AX-Ser139 increased, at the same time, the E1A gene and the Hexon proteins of oncolytic adenovirus were increased after irradiation. Conclusions Our results proved synergistic antitumor effect of adenovirus Ad-PSCAE-UPII-E1A and radiation, which might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the bladder cancer.PMID: 27599968Title: Simple and Efficient Stratification of Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients.Authors: Zoidakis JSource: EBioMedicine. 2016 Aug 28. pii: S2352-3964(16)30397-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.041.Abstract: ?PMID: 27599849Title: Plasma and urine DNA levels are related to microscopic hematuria in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma.Authors: de Almeida EF, Abdalla TE, Arrym TP, de Oliveira Delgado P, Wroclawski ML, da Costa Aguiar Alves B, de S Gehrke F, Azzalis LA, Alves S, Tobias-Machado M, de Lima Pompeo AC, Fonseca FLSource: Clin Biochem. 2016 Sep 4. pii: S0009-9120(16)30226-0. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2016.08.021.Abstract: a) Objective: An increase in cell-free DNA was observed in the plasma of many cancer patients. This major biomarker can be used to differentiate patients with malignant neoplasms from those with benign neoplasms or healthy patients. Depending on the characteristic of the tumor, there are qualitative variations in the circulating cell-free DNA. Today, studies on the concentration of fragments of circulating cell-free DNA and their respective sizes in patients with bladder cancer are not plentiful in the literature. A 100% effective plasma tumor marker, which would help in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer, is yet to be developed; therefore, cell-free DNA levels in the plasma may represent a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with this type of tumor. b) Design and methods: In this study we analyze the kinetics of plasma and urine DNA concentrations in patients with bladder cancer, relating them to the other clinical laboratory variables. c) Results: Patients with hematuria showed a positive correlation with urine DNA. d) Conclusion: An increase in plasma and urine DNA was unprecedentedly reported over time, a fact that may come in handy in the prognosis of patients. Furthermore, microscopic haematuria is correlated with plasma and urinary DNA levels.PMID: 27599742Title: Synthesis of novel arylaminoquinazolinylurea derivatives and their antiproliferative activities against bladder cancer cell line.Authors: Kim JH, Kwak Y, Song C, Roh EJ, Oh CH, Lee SH, Sim T, Choi JH, Yoo KHSource: Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2016 Aug 24. pii: S0960-894X(16)30908-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.08.076.Abstract: A novel series of arylurea and arylamide derivatives 1a-z, 2a-d having aminoquinazoline scaffold was designed and synthesized. Their in vitro antiproliferative activities against RT112 bladder cancer cell line and inhibitory activities against FGFR3 kinase were tested. Most compounds showed good antiproliferative activities against RT112 bladder cancer cell line, and arylurea compounds 1a-z were more potent than arylamide compounds 2a-d. Among them, eight compounds 1a, 1d-g, 1l, 1y, and 1z showed potent activities with GI50 values below submicromolar range. Especially, arylurea compounds 1d and 1g possessing 2,3-dimethyl and 3,4-dimethyl moieties exhibited superior or similar antiproliferative activity (GI50=8.8nM and 30.2nM, respectively) to AZD4547 (GI50=29.2nM) as a reference standard.PMID: 27599396Title: Clinical significance of CD44 variant 9 expression as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer.Authors: Kobayashi K, Matsumoto H, Matsuyama H, Fujii N, Inoue R, Yamamoto Y, Nagao KSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5061.Abstract: CD44, a major surface receptor for hyaluronic acid, has multiple isoforms and represents a major cancer stem cell marker for various epithelial tumors. CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9) was correlated with recurrence and metastasis in gastric and colon cancer. We examined its role in invasion and as a biomarker for the basal muscle invasive molecular subtype showing worse prognosis, and for tumor progression in high risk (pT1/high grade) nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs). CD44v9, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 98 pathologically confirmed specimens (36 muscle and 62 highrisk nonmuscle) and correlated to clinical outcome. In vitro analysis was performed using two human bladder cancer cell lines (HT1376 and 5637). The CD44v9 highexpressing group exhibited significantly lower progressionfree and cancerspecific survival rates in both muscle (P=0.0349 and 0.0382, respectively) and nonmuscle (P=0.0002 and 0.0079) invasive patients. CD44v9 expression was significantly correlated with CK5/6 (P<0.001), colocalizing at the muscle invasion front but distinctly separated from CK20 in nonmuscle invasion. CD44 and CD44v9 siRNA knockdown demonstrated significantly lower Matrigel invasion ability and significantly shorter migration distance (all P<0.01). CD44 and CD44v9 knockdown increased Ecadherin and decreased Ncadherin, snail, and slug epithelialmesenchymal transition marker protein expression. Thus, higher CD44v9 expression was associated with worse prognosis, likely impacting invasion and migration via the epithelialmesenchymal transition. Together, these findings suggest that CD44v9 expression might be a useful predictive biomarker in basaltype muscle and high-risk NMIBC.PMID: 27598809Title: Direction Modulated Brachytherapy for Treatment of Cervical Cancer. II: Comparative Planning Study With Intracavitary and Intracavitary-Interstitial Techniques.Authors: Han DY, Safigholi H, Soliman A, Ravi A, Leung E, Scanderbeg DJ, Liu Z, Owrangi A, Song WYSource: Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2016 Oct 1;96(2):440-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.015. Epub 2016 Jun 22.Abstract: PURPOSE: To perform a comprehensive comparative planning study evaluating the utility of the proposed direction modulated brachytherapy (DMBT) tandem applicator against standard applicators, in the setting of image guided adaptive brachytherapy of cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A detailed conceptual article was published in 2014. The proposed DMBT tandem applicator has 6 peripheral grooves of 1.3-mm width, along a 5.4-mm-thick nonmagnetic tungsten alloy rod of density 18.0 g/cm(3), capable of generating directional dose profiles. We performed a comparative planning study with 45 cervical cancer patients enrolled consecutively in the prospective observational EMBRACE study. In all patients, MRI-based planning was performed while utilizing various tandem-ring (27 patients) and tandem-ring-needles (18 patients) applicators, in accordance with the Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie-European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology recommendations. For unbiased comparisons, all cases were replanned with an in-house-developed inverse optimization code while enforcing a uniform set of constraints that are reflective of the clinical practice. All plans were normalized to the same high-risk clinical target volume D90 values achieved in the original clinical plans. RESULTS: In general, if the standard tandem was replaced with the DMBT tandem while maintaining all other planning conditions the same, there was consistent improvement in the plan quality. For example, among the 18 tandem-ring-needles cases, the average D2cm(3) reductions achieved were -2.48% +/- 11.03%, -4.45% +/- 5.24%, and -5.66% +/- 6.43% for the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid, respectively. An opportunity may also exist in avoiding use of needles altogether for when the total number of needles required is small (approximately 2 to 3 needles or less), if DMBT tandem is used. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating the novel DMBT tandem onto both intracavitary and intracavitary-interstitial applicator assembly enabled consistent improvement in the sparing of the OARs, over a standard "single-channel" tandem, though individual variations in benefit were considerable. Although at an early stage of development, the DMBT concept design is demonstrated to be useful and pragmatic for potential clinical translation.PMID: 27598808Title: Optimal Patient Positioning (Prone Versus Supine) for VMAT in Gynecologic Cancer: A Dosimetric Study on the Effect of Different Margins.Authors: Heijkoop ST, Westerveld H, Bijker N, Feije R, Sharfo AW, van Wieringen N, Mens JW, Stalpers LJ, Hoogeman MSSource: Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2016 Oct 1;96(2):432-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.05.025. Epub 2016 Jun 8.Abstract: PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether the historically found dosimetric advantages of treating gynecologic cancer with the patient in a prone position with use of a small-bowel displacement device (belly-board) remain when volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) is used and whether these advantages depend on the necessary margin between clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV). The aim of this study is to determine the best patient position (prone or supine) in terms of sparing organs at risk (OAR) for various CTV-to-PTV margins and VMAT dose delivery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In an institutional review board-approved study, 26 patients with gynecologic cancer scheduled for primary (9) or postoperative (17) radiation therapy were scanned in a prone position on a belly-board and in a supine position on the same day. The primary tumor CTV, nodal CTV, bladder, bowel, and rectum were delineated on both scans. The PTVs were created each with a different margin for the primary tumor and nodal CTV. The VMAT plans were generated with our in-house system for automated treatment planning. For all margin combinations, the supine and prone plans were compared with consideration of all OAR dose-volume parameters but with highest priority given to bowel cavity V45Gy (cm(3)). RESULTS: For both groups, the prone position reduced the bowel cavity V45Gy, in particular for nodal margins >/=10 mm (DeltaV45Gy = 23.9 +/- 10.6 cm(3)). However, for smaller margins, the advantage was much less pronounced (DeltaV45Gy = 6.5 +/- 3.0 cm(3)) and did not reach statistical significance. The rectum mean dose (Dmean) was significantly lower (DeltaDmean = 2.5 +/- 0.3 Gy) in the prone position for both patient groups and for all margins, and the bladder Dmean was significantly lower in the supine position (DeltaDmean = 2.6 +/- 0.4 Gy) only for the postoperative group. The advantage of the prone position was not present if it needed a larger margin than the supine position. CONCLUSION: For patients with gynecologic cancer, the historically found dosimetric advantages for the prone position remain for modern dose delivery techniques if large margins are needed. However, the advantage is lost for small margins and if the prone position needs a larger margin than the supine position.PMID: 27598218Title: An Epigenomic Approach to Improving Response to Neoadjuvant Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Bladder Cancer.Authors: Xylinas E, Hassler MR, Zhuang D, Krzywinski M, Erdem Z, Robinson BD, Elemento O, Clozel T, Shariat SFSource: Biomolecules. 2016 Sep 2;6(3). pii: E37. doi: 10.3390/biom6030037.Abstract: Bladder cancer is among the five most common cancers diagnosed in the Western world and causes significant mortality and morbidity rates in affected patients. Therapeutic options to treat the disease in advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) include cystectomy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is effective in MIBC; however, it has not been widely adopted by the community. One reason is that many patients do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and no biomarker currently exists to identify these patients. It is also not clear whether a strategy to sensitize chemoresistant patients may exist. We sought to identify cisplatin-resistance patterns in preclinical models of bladder cancer, and test whether treatment with the epigenetic modifier decitabine is able to sensitize cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines. Using a screening approach in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines, we identified dysregulated genes by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and DNA methylation assays. DNA methylation analysis of tumors from 18 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy was used to confirm in vitro results. Cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells were treated with decitabine to investigate epigenetic sensitization of resistant cell lines. Our results show that HOXA9 promoter methylation status is associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in bladder cancer cell lines and in metastatic bladder cancer. Bladder cancer cells resistant to cisplatin chemotherapy can be sensitized to cisplatin by the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine. Our data suggest that HOXA9 promoter methylation could serve as potential predictive biomarker and decitabine might sensitize resistant tumors in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.PMID: 27598027Title: Dogs'olfactory diagnostics applied on human species: state of the art and clinical perspectives.Authors: Palmieri B, Nardo B, Lippi G, Palmieri L, Vadala M, Laurino CSource: Clin Ter. 2016 Jul-Aug;167(4):e78-84. doi: 10.7417/CT.2016.1943.Abstract: Dogs'smell ability is about 10000-100000 more developed than humans' one. Dogs smell is usually exploited in forensic medicine, to find missing people and specific substances showing peculiar sensorial features. In clinic, there is the possibility to take advantage of dogs smell, which are conveniently trained, for the screening of cancers and other diseases. The common feature is the presence of molecules in organic samples that may be considered as biomarkers of a specific pathology. In cancer, scientific evidences exist about screening of melanoma, lung, breast, rectum, ovarian, prostate and bladder cancer. Instead, other pathologies manifest the presence of organic volatile compounds in biologic materials, such as spit, faeces and urine that may be studied by dogs smell in order to identify the presence of a specific disease. This review shows the state of the art of actual dogs' olfactory ability based on scientific principles and the advantages and the disadvantages of this method. The authors also reveal some potential pathologies joined by the presence of organic volatile compounds, which may be investigated by dogs smell.PMID: 27597124Title: Recent progress with next-generation biomarkers in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Contreras-Sanz A, Roberts ME, Seiler R, Black PCSource: Int J Urol. 2016 Sep 6. doi: 10.1111/iju.13193.Abstract: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes. Histomorphological variants, variable mutation rates and aberrant protein expression, along with the recently identified molecular subtypes, have been linked to prognosis and response to therapy. Complete response to chemotherapy and outcome after radical cystectomy are difficult to predict. To date, no validated pathological or clinical test exists to predict response. Advances in high-throughput, next-generation, genomic techniques to study the molecular pathways that govern the disease have led to novel strategies for the identification of such biomarkers relevant to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Progress has been made not only in tissue-based biomarkers, but also in the liquid biopsy field. Liquid biopsies represent an opportunity to obtain patient samples non-invasively at multiple time-points during their treatment course without the need for biopsy. Especially in the metastatic setting, this will allow monitoring of the molecular evolution of the tumor under treatment, which should inform subsequent therapeutic decisions.PMID: 27596300Title: Association of thymosin beta4 expression with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes of bladder cancer patients.Authors: Wang ZY, Zhang W, Yang JJ, Song DK, Wei JX, Gao SSource: Neoplasma. 2016 Sep 6;(6). doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_619.Abstract: The clinical significance of thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) expression in bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC) remains unclear. The present study assessed the relationship between the expression of Tbeta4 protein and the clinicopathological features, as well as the prognosis of bladder cancer patients. Tbeta4 protein expression in 24 normal bladder and 138 primary BTCC tissue specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the association of this expression with BTCC clinicopathological features and recurrence as well as patient survival was analyzed. Tbeta4 expression was significantly stronger in BTCC patients than in normal volunteers. The expression of Tbeta4 was significantly associated with differentiation capability, tumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.025, 0.043, and 0.039, respectively). Moreover, Tbeta4 expression was positively correlated with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and beta-catenin expression (P = 0.042, 0.031, respectively) and inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression (P = 0.022). In the present cohort of bladder cancer patients, Tbeta4 expression was found to be a predictor of poor survival (P < 0.05); however, high Tbeta4 expression exhibited unfavorable prognostic value for recurrence. These data suggested that Tbeta4 is correlated with the pathogenesis of BTCC. In addition, the patients with higher Tbeta4 expression had a shorter survival.PMID: 27596297Title: Comparison of the combination therapy of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and mitomycin C with the monotherapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.Authors: Lan Y, Liu D, Lin MSource: Neoplasma. 2016 Sep 6;(6). doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_616.Abstract: Urinary bladder cancer is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide. Non-muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC) has a very low curative rate after resection. The meta-analysis aims to compare efficiency of the combination therapy of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and mitomycin C (MMC) with each monotherapy on NMIBC treatment. Articles were retrieved in relevant databases up to May, 2016. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess quality of the included studies. Risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the effect size to calculate pooled result. Funnel plot and Egger's test were applied to examine publication bias. Sensitive analysis was performed. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. As a result, the BCG+MMC combination therapy had a significantly decreased recurrence rate in NMIBC patients, compared with monotherapy of BCG or MMC (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.92, P < 0.001). However, there were no obvious differences between the two regimens regarding to progression rate, overall mortality and disease-specific mortality (P > 0.050). Subgroup analysis indicated the combination therapy was more advantageous than BCG (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.87) but not MMC monotherapy (P > 0.050), on the reduced recurrence rate. 81mg/week BCG + 30 mg/week MMC had a significant lower progression rate than BCG (RR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.24 to 0.82). In conclusion, BCG+MMC combination therapy is more advantageous than BCG to NMIBC patients with reduced recurrence rate.PMID: 27596295Title: Genetic diversity of urinary bladder cancer and the risk of recurrence based on mutation analysis.Authors: Traczyk-Borszynska M, Borkowska E, Jablonowski Z, Jedrzejczyk A, Pietrusinski M, Kaluzewski B, Sosnowski M, Borowiec MSource: Neoplasma. 2016 Sep 6;(6). doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_614.Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess the genetic diversity of bladder cancer and determine the suitability of a proposed molecular marker panel to monitor the course of bladder cancer patients. The study involved 185 patients with diagnosed bladder cancer. The genetic diversity of the bladder cancer was evaluated by the prevalence of mutations in the TP53, HRAS, FGFR3 and WWOX genes. Mutations were detected in 62.2% of the tumor samples. The most frequently mutated genes were FGFR3 (49.7%) and TP53 (16.2%). No mutation was observed in the WWOX gene. FGFR3 mutations, contrary to TP53, correlated with lower tumor stage and grade, and the presence of multiple tumors. The risk of death was significantly higher in patients with TP53 mutant tumors (HR=3.12; 95%CI: 1.14-7.27; p=0.006) but lower in patients with FGFR3 mutations (HR=0.36; 95%CI: 0.15-0.87; p=0.002). None of the investigated genes was an independent predictor of disease-specific survival, recurrence-free survival or progression-free survival. The results confirm the existence of two alternative pathways of bladder cancer. However the presence of a high percentage of wild type variants in the higher stages of the disease suggest the existence of another pathway of molecular changes leading to the development of bladder cancer. Molecular analysis may have prognostic value and may facilitate the assignment of patients to appropriate forms of treatment - especially in the case of patients with a T1 tumor, where different mutational patterns were observed in each grade.PMID: 27595989Title: CD44 and RHAMM are essential for rapid growth of bladder cancer driven by loss of Glycogen Debranching Enzyme (AGL).Authors: Oldenburg D, Ru Y, Weinhaus B, Cash S, Theodorescu D, Guin SSource: BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 5;16:713. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2756-5.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Loss of Amylo-alpha-1-6-glucosidase-4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL) drives rapid proliferation of bladder cancer cells by upregulating Hyaluronic acid(HA) Synthase (HAS2) mediated HA synthesis. However the role of HA receptors CD44 and Hyaluronan Mediated Motility Receptor (RHAMM) in regulating the growth of bladder cancer cells driven by loss of AGL has not been studied. METHODS: Western blot analysis and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was carried out to study cellular apoptosis with HAS2, CD44 and RHAMM loss in bladder cancer cells with and without AGL expression. Proliferation and softagar assays were carried out to study cellular anchorage dependent and independent growth. Clinicopathologic analysis was carried out on bladder cancer patient datasets. RESULTS: Higher amounts of cleaved Cas3, Cas9 and PARP was observed in AGL low bladder cancer cell with loss of HAS2, CD44 or RHAMM. TUNEL staining showed more apoptotic cells with loss of HAS2, CD44 or RHAMM in AGL low bladder cancer cells. This revealed that bladder cancer cells whose aggressive growth is mediated by loss of AGL are susceptible to apoptosis with loss of HAS2, CD44 or RHAMM. Interestingly loss of either CD44 or RHAMM induces apoptosis in different low AGL expressing bladder cancer cell lines. Growth assays showed that loss of CD44 and RHAMM predominantly inhibit anchorage dependent and independent growth of AGL low bladder cancer cells. Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that high RHAMM mRNA expression is a marker of poor patient outcome in bladder cancer and patients with high RHAMM and low AGL tumor mRNA expression have poor survival. CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly point to the importance of the HAS2-HA-CD44/RHAMM pathway for rapid growth of bladder cancer cells with loss of AGL and provides rational for targeting this pathway at various steps for "personalized" treatment of bladder cancer patients based of their AGL expression status.PMID: 27595462Title: Treatment of ureteral anastomotic strictures with reimplantation and survival after cystectomy and urinary diversion.Authors: Helfand AM, Beach R, Hadj-Moussa M, Krishnan N, He C, Montgomery JS, Morgan TM, Weizer AZ, Hafez K, Lee CT, Stoffel JT, Skolarus TASource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Aug 29. pii: S1078-1439(16)30204-6. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.07.018.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine whether long-term renal function and overall survival outcomes vary according to management approach for ureteral anastomotic stricture (UAS) after cystectomy and urinary diversion. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with benign UAS following cystectomy and urinary diversion using our institutional database. We compared time to stricture, renal function, rates of renal loss, and overall survival between patients undergoing ureteral reimplantation vs. those undergoing nonoperative management (nephrostomy tube or ureteral stent). A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine whether reimplantation was independently associated with overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 87 UAS in 69 patients. Reimplantation was performed in 26 patients (37.7%), and 43 patients (62.3%) were managed nonoperatively. The interval between cystectomy and stricture diagnosis was similar in the reimplanted and nonoperative groups (3.06 vs. 4.34mo, P = 0.42). The differences between baseline and follow-up creatinine levels (+0.40 vs.+0.40mg/dl, P = 0.72) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (-25.0 vs.-18.9ml/min/1.73m2, P = 0.66) were similar between groups, as were rates of renal loss (34.6% vs. 39.5%, P = 0.68); however, mortality was significantly higher in the nonoperative group. After multivariable adjustment, overall survival remained significantly higher among UAS patients who underwent reimplantation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for risk of death = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.13-0.80). CONCLUSION: Reimplantation was associated with improved overall survival but not with improved long-term renal functional outcomes compared with nonoperative management. Nonrenal complications of nonoperative UAS management may play an important role in reducing longevity.PMID: 27595416Title: Closing the Gender Gap: Can We Improve Bladder Cancer Survival in Women? - A Systematic Review of Diagnosis, Treatment and Outcomes.Authors: Burge F, Kockelbergh RSource: Urol Int. 2016 Sep 6.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite recent attention, there are no gender specific guidelines to address the disparity in bladder cancer survival between the sexes. The focus of this review was to identify areas of clinical practice that may influence bladder cancer outcomes and to provide evidence-based recommendations to improve bladder cancer survival in women. METHOD: A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify studies related to referral, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of patients with bladder cancer with particular reference to gender differences. RESULTS: Patients' knowledge of key signs and symptoms of bladder cancer is poor. There is evidence that there is a gender difference in referral patterns both at patient and primary care level. The presence of cystits, in particular, delays referral. Treatment and surveillance of high-risk non-muscle invasive cancers is variable and non-urothelial bladder cancer, which has higher incidence in women is more likely to be treated non-operatively than urothelial bladder cancer. CONCLUSION: We have offered recommendations to improve patient education and streamline referrals and suggested considerations for treatment of high-risk cancers to help improve survival in female bladder cancer patients.PMID: 27594736Title: New Progress of Epigenetic Biomarkers in Urological Cancer.Authors: Wu P, Cao Z, Wu SSource: Dis Markers. 2016;2016:9864047. doi: 10.1155/2016/9864047. Epub 2016 Aug 9.Abstract: Urological cancers consist of bladder, kidney, prostate, and testis cancers and they are generally silenced at their early stage, which leads to the loss of the best opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. Desired biomarkers are scarce for urological cancers and current biomarkers are lack of specificity and sensitivity. Epigenetic alterations are characteristic of nearly all kinds of human malignances including DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA regulation. Besides, the detection of these epigenetic conditions is easily accessible especially for urine, best target for monitoring the diseases of urinary system. Here, we summarize some new progress about epigenetic biomarkers in urological cancers, hoping to provide new thoughts for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of urological cancers.PMID: 27594510Title: A combination of p40, GATA-3 and uroplakin II shows utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.Authors: Leivo MZ, Elson PJ, Tacha DE, Delahunt B, Hansel DESource: Pathology. 2016 Oct;48(6):543-9. doi: 10.1016/j.pathol.2016.05.008. Epub 2016 Sep 2.Abstract: Recently developed antibodies against uroplakin II and DeltaNp63 (p40) show utility in diagnosing primary bladder urothelial carcinoma, although application in metastatic bladder cancer and patient outcomes has been less well defined. We evaluated these antibodies by immunostain intensity and H-score, in conjunction with GATA-3 immunoreactivity, in 89 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma and 35 paired metastasis. The maintenance of immunoreactivity in metastatic lesions and the association to disease recurrence and survival was assessed. Bladder urothelial carcinoma showed immunoreactivity for GATA-3 in 99% (88/89), p40 in 87% (77/89) and uroplakin II in 80% (71/89) of cases, with a positive correlation between GATA-3 and uroplakin II H-score (0.44; p < 0.0001). All lesions were positive for at least one marker, reinforcing the use of these markers as a panel. In 35 patients with paired lymph node metastasis, uroplakin II and GATA-3 were retained in 90% and 75% of patients, respectively, suggesting these markers may have relatively high sensitivity in diagnosing metastatic urothelial carcinoma. High intensity p40 immunostain (3+), however, was significantly associated with reduced patient survival (p = 0.03). These results suggest that whereas GATA-3 and uroplakin II may be most useful in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma metastasis, p40 may be additionally suited as a prognostic marker.PMID: 27593345Title: An Osteopontin/CD44 Axis in RhoGDI2-Mediated Metastasis Suppression.Authors: Ahmed M, Sottnik JL, Dancik GM, Sahu D, Hansel DE, Theodorescu D, Schwartz MASource: Cancer Cell. 2016 Sep 12;30(3):432-43. doi: 10.1016/j.ccell.2016.08.002. Epub 2016 Sep 1.Abstract: RhoGDI2 specifically suppresses bladder cancer metastasis but not primary tumor growth, which involves tumor-associated macrophages. We report that macrophage-secreted osteopontin binds to CD44s on the tumor cells and promotes invasion and clonal growth. These effects are RhoGDI2-sensitive and require CD44s binding to the Rac GEF TIAM1. Osteopontin expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome in patients. Inhibiting this pathway potently blocked lung and lymph node metastasis; however, primary tumors and established metastasis were less sensitive. Osteopontin-CD44s-TIAM1 promotes clonal growth in vitro but not at high cell density. These data identify osteopontin-CD44-TIAM1-Rac1 axis as a RhoGDI2-sensitive pathway and potential therapeutic target in bladder cancer metastasis. They also elucidate the mechanism behind RhoGDI2 specificity for metastasis over established tumors.PMID: 27592530Title: Malignant urachal neoplasms: A population-based study and systematic review of literature.Authors: Mylonas KS, OMalley P, Ziogas IA, El-Kabab L, Nasioudis DSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 1. pii: S1078-1439(16)30207-1. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.07.021.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To examine patient and clinicopathological features of malignant urachal neoplasms (MUN) in a population-based cohort, to investigate survival outcomes, and to review the current evidence that exists in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify microscopically confirmed MUN cases diagnosed between 1988 and 2012. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine median and 5-year overall survival (OS) as well as cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates. Cox proportional hazards model was employed to identify variables independently associated with cancer-specific mortality. A systematic literature review was conducted in line with the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients with MUNs were identified. The majority were white (77.6%) and male patients (59%) who presented with low-grade (62.1%), mucinous, noncystic adenocarcinomas (42.9%). From the cohort, 19%, 15.2%, 29.5%, and 30.5% of the patients presented with American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I to IV disease, respectively. Cancer-directed surgery was performed in 86.5% of the patients. The most common procedure performed was partial cystectomy (52.4%) followed by local tumor excision (20.7%). Median OS was 57 months (95% CI: 41.6-72.4), and median CSS was 105 months (95% CI: 61.5-148.5). Five-year OS and CSS rates were 51% and 57%, respectively. Grade and stage were independently associated with cancer-specific mortality. Mortality rates did not differ between patients who underwent partial cystectomy and radical cystectomy/exenteration (P = 0.165), even after controlling for tumor stage. A total of 16 studies reporting on 585 patients were systematically reviewed, and relevant outcomes were summarized in the Supplemental material. CONCLUSIONS: MUNs are usually low-grade, mucinous, noncystic adenocarcinomas diagnosed at advanced stages. Overall, the prognosis is poor, and high-grade and disease stage are independently associated with cancer-specific mortality.PMID: 27592529Title: Upstaging of nonurothelial histology in bladder cancer at the time of surgical treatment in the National Cancer Data Base.Authors: Cohen AJ, Packiam V, Nottingham C, Steinberg G, Smith ND, Patel SSource: Urol Oncol. 2016 Sep 1. pii: S1078-1439(16)30210-1. doi: 10.1016/j.urolonc.2016.08.002.Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine patient and pathologic characteristics as well as outcomes for patients with clinically localized, nonurothelial histology bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, we identified patients between 2000 and 2010 diagnosed with bladder cancer as their only malignancy undergoing definitive surgical management. Patients were characterized as urothelial (n = 13,442), squamous (n = 789), small cell (n = 124), adenocarcinoma (n = 789), or other histology (n = 499). Patient and pathologic characteristics were compared across histologic subtypes. We also evaluated for incidence of T and N upstaging. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analysis was performed to identify predictors of adverse overall survival. RESULTS: Patients with nonurothelial histology were more likely to be African-American, treated at academic medical centers, and of younger age (all P<0.05). Among those with nonurothelial histology, 55.4% of patients presenting with clinical stage T1 or less had their tumor upstaged during definitive surgical treatment compared to 42.7% of those with urothelial carcinoma. Squamous histology incurred the highest upgrading rate of 61.8%. Five-year survival varied by subtype, with universally decreased survival for those upstaged. Among nonurothelial histology, overall 5-year survival was 32.4% (95% CI: 28.8%-36.2%) vs. 46.0% (95% CI: 42.3%-49.6%) for those upstaged and not upstaged, respectively. Neoadjuvant therapy is used infrequently in this population. CONCLUSION: We present the largest survival analysis of various rare subtypes of bladder cancer to date. Patients with nonurothelial bladder cancer have significantly higher rate of upstaging at cystectomy and with this a worsened overall survival. Aggressive treatment should be strongly considered for nonurothelial cancers when identified.PMID: 27592258Title: Myopodin methylation is a prognostic biomarker and predicts antiangiogenic response in advanced kidney cancer.Authors: Pompas-Veganzones N, Sandonis V, Perez-Lanzac A, Beltran M, Beardo P, Juarez A, Vazquez F, Cozar JM, Alvarez-Ossorio JL, Sanchez-Carbayo MSource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 3.Abstract: Myopodin is a cytoskeleton protein that shuttles to the nucleus depending on the cellular differentiation and stress. It has shown tumor suppressor functions. Myopodin methylation status was useful for staging bladder and colon tumors and predicting clinical outcome. To our knowledge, myopodin has not been tested in kidney cancer to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether myopodin methylation status could be clinically useful in renal cancer (1) as a prognostic biomarker and 2) as a predictive factor of response to antiangiogenic therapy in patients with metastatic disease. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reactions (MS-PCR) were used to evaluate myopodin methylation in 88 kidney tumors. These belonged to patients with localized disease and no evidence of disease during follow-up (n = 25) (group 1), and 63 patients under antiangiogenic therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and temsirolimus), from which group 2 had non-metastatic disease at diagnosis (n = 32), and group 3 showed metastatic disease at diagnosis (n = 31). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were utilized to assess outcome and response to antiangiogenic agents taking progression, disease-specific survival, and overall survival as clinical endpoints. Myopodin was methylated in 50 out of the 88 kidney tumors (56.8 %). Among the 88 cases analyzed, 10 of them recurred (11.4 %), 51 progressed (57.9 %), and 40 died of disease (45.4 %). Myopodin methylation status correlated to MSKCC Risk score (p = 0.050) and the presence of distant metastasis (p = 0.039). Taking all patients, an unmethylated myopodin identified patients with shorter progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. Using also in univariate and multivariate models, an unmethylated myopodin predicted response to antiangiogenic therapy (groups 2 and 3) using progression-free survival, disease-specific, and overall survival as clinical endpoints. Myopodin was revealed hypermethylated in kidney cancer. Myopodin methylation status identified which patients showed a more aggressive clinical behavior and predicted antiangiogenic response. These observations support the clinical utility of an unmethylated myopodin as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in kidney cancer.PMID: 27592221Title: Carcinoma arising in enteric diversion or rectal neobladder for bladder exstrophy.Authors: Ragu R, Meurette G, Kim M, Le Normand L, Lehur PASource: Tech Coloproctol. 2016 Sep 3.Abstract: Bladder exstrophy is a rare malformation. Ureteral diversion, such as ureterosigmoidostomy or a neorectal bladder, has been described. When the patients reach adulthood, cancer may arise in these reconstructions. Our aim was to perform a systematic review (all languages) of the published literature on neoplasia after urinary diversion and suggested management in cases of cancer. PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for relevant articles published within the last 20 years. All identified articles were reviewed for inclusion. Carcinoma occurring in the bladder and unreconstructed exstrophy were excluded. Out of 47 articles found, 12 matched our search criteria. The outcomes of 23 patients (including 2 from the authors' institution) were reported. Twenty-two patients with adenocarcinoma and 1 with carcinoid tumour were identified. Median age at urinary diversion was 3 (range 1-13) years. There were 20 ureterosigmoidostomies and 2 neorectal bladders. Cancer was diagnosed subsequently at a median of 31 (range 5-55) years after urinary diversion still in place (n = 18) or 21 years (range 1-30) after incomplete excision of ureteric stump when re-diverted (n = 5). The long-term outcomes of 15 patients were available. Ten died due to colorectal adenocarcinoma, and 5 were disease-free at 3 years. Patients with enteric diversion for bladder exstrophy, including those with subsequent reconstruction, are at risk of adenocarcinoma during adulthood. It is important to provide adequate surveillance. If lesions suggestive of carcinoma are seen, complete excision of the receptive bowel and urinary diversion are mandatory.PMID: 27591936Title: Long non-coding RNA UCA1 promotes cisplatin/gemcitabine resistance through CREB modulating miR-196a-5p in bladder cancer cells.Authors: Pan J, Li X, Wu W, Xue M, Hou H, Zhai W, Chen WSource: Cancer Lett. 2016 Aug 31;382(1):64-76. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2016.08.015.Abstract: Chemoresistance constitutes the major failing of clinical therapy for bladder cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the chemoresistance of bladder cancer are unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Urothelial Cancer Associated 1 (UCA1), an lncRNA, is reportedly upregulated in human bladder carcinoma and promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. In the present study, knockdown of UCA1 decreased chemosensitivity to cisplatin/gemcitabine by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, while overexpression of UCA1 increased chemosensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, UCA1 activated transcription factor CREB which led to miR-196a-5p expression by binding with its promoter. miR-196a-5p induction is involved in UCA1 inhibition of apoptosis induced by cisplatin/gemcitabine via targeting p27Kip1. These results provide a novel UCA1-CREB-miR-196a-5p paradigm to explain in part how UCA1 functions in cisplatin/gemcitabine resistance, and suggest that UCA1 may be a potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in bladder cancer.PMID: 27591931Title: EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer. Part II: Treatment of Relapsing, Metastatic, and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.Authors: Cornford P, Bellmunt J, Bolla M, Briers E, De Santis M, Gross T, Henry AM, Joniau S, Lam TB, Mason MD, van der Poel HG, van der Kwast TH, Rouviere O, Wiegel T, Mottet NSource: Eur Urol. 2016 Aug 31. pii: S0302-2838(16)30469-9. doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2016.08.002.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on the treatment of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013-2015). The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the literature. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Relapse after local therapy is defined by a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >0.2ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and >2ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography is of limited importance if PSA is <1.0ng/ml; bone scans and computed tomography can be omitted unless PSA is >10ng/ml. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are important to assess biochemical failure following RT. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels <0.5ng/ml and salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryosurgical ablation or salvage brachytherapy of the prostate in radiation failures. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the basis for treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, docetaxel combined with ADT should be considered the standard of care for men with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. Follow-up of ADT should include analysis of PSA, testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Level 1 evidence for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) includes, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA/P), enzalutamide, radium 223 (Ra 223), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 wk and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium are approved for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for use in clinical practice. These PCa guidelines are the first endorsed by the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office or online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/). PATIENT SUMMARY: In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only, it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients. For patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear survival benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis.PMID: 27591565Title: Antitumor activity evaluation of meso-tetra (pyrrolidine substituted) pentylporphin-mediated photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo.Authors: Zhang LJ, Zhang XH, Liao PY, Sun JJ, Wang L, Yan YJ, Chen ZLSource: J Photochem Photobiol B. 2016 Aug 30;163:224-231. doi: 10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.08.044.Abstract: Photodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive and promising new method in cancer treatment and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. An ideal photosensitizer is a crucial element to photodynamic therapy. In the present paper, a novel porphyrin derivative, 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentyl) porphin (TPPP) was synthesized. Its spectroscopic and physicochemical properties, therapeutic efficacy as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy for human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo were investigated. TPPP had strong absorption at 648nm (epsilon=1.75x104M-1cm-1), and two fluorescence emission peaks at 652nm and 718nm. PDT with TPPP showed low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity to human bladder cancer T24 cells in vitro. In bearing T24 tumor nude mice, the growth of tumor was significantly inhibited by combining use of 5mg/kg TPPP with 100J/cm2 (650nm, 180mW/cm2) laser irradiation at 3h following injection of TPPP. The antitumor effect was also confirmed with histopathological assay. The histopathological study results revealed that PDT using TPPP and 100J/cm2 (650nm, 180mW/cm2) laser irradiation induced tumor cells shrunken and necrotic. These results indicate that TPPP is useful as a new photosensitizer in PDT for cancer, and deserves further investigation.PMID: 27590617Title: Patient characteristics associated with undergoing cancer operations at low-volume hospitals.Authors: Liu JB, Bilimoria KY, Mallin K, Winchester DPSource: Surgery. 2016 Aug 30. pii: S0039-6060(16)30402-0. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2016.07.027.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although strong volume-outcome relationships exist for many cancer operations, patients continue to undergo these operations at low-volume hospitals. METHODS: Patients were identified from the National Cancer Data Base from 2010-2013 who underwent resection for bladder, breast, esophagus, lung, pancreas, rectum, and stomach cancers. Low-volume hospitals were defined as those in the bottom quartile by surgical volume for each cancer type separately. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess patient-level factors associated with undergoing cancer surgery at low-volume hospitals across cancer types while controlling for tumor characteristics. Survival outcomes (30- and 90-day mortality; overall survival) were also assessed. RESULTS: Low volume thresholds were 4, 84, 4, 18, 8, 7, and 4 resections per year for bladder, breast, esophagus, lung, pancreas, rectum, and stomach cancers, respectively, resulting in 772 (74.1%), 828 (57.5%), 664 (77.5%), 830 (64.7%), 716 (79.2%), 898 (65.1%), and 888 (68.5%) hospitals classified as low-volume hospitals, respectively. For all the cancers examined, patients were more likely to undergo operation at low-volume hospitals if they traveled shorter distances (home to surgical facility), resided in rural locations, or had not received neoadjuvant therapy. Other patient and tumor factors were not associated consistently with undergoing operation at low-volume hospitals. Patients who went to low-volume hospitals had poorer outcomes among the studied cancers. CONCLUSION: Patients continue to undergo operation at low-volume hospitals due to where they live and how far they have to travel. Regionalization policy initiatives will remain challenging in this population. Efforts should therefore continue to emphasize quality improvement locally at each facility caring for patients with cancer.PMID: 27590593Title: Drug-eluting biodegradable ureteral stent: New approach for urothelial tumors of upper urinary tract cancer.Authors: Barros AA, Browne S, Oliveira C, Lima E, Duarte AR, Healy KE, Reis RLSource: Int J Pharm. 2016 Aug 31;513(1-2):227-237. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.08.061.Abstract: Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) accounts for 5-10% of urothelial carcinomas and is a disease that has not been widely studied as carcinoma of the bladder. To avoid the problems of conventional therapies, such as the need for frequent drug instillation due to poor drug retention, we developed a biodegradable ureteral stent (BUS) impregnated by supercritical fluid CO2 (scCO2) with the most commonly used anti-cancer drugs, namely paclitaxel, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine. The release kinetics of anti-cancer therapeutics from drug-eluting stents was measured in artificial urine solution (AUS). The in vitro release showed a faster release in the first 72h for the four anti-cancer drugs, after this time a plateau was achieved and finally the stent degraded after 9days. Regarding the amount of impregnated drugs by scCO2, gemcitabine showed the highest amount of loading (19.57mug drug/mg polymer: 2% loaded), while the lowest amount was obtained for paclitaxel (0.067mug drug/mg polymer: 0.01% loaded). A cancer cell line (T24) was exposed to graded concentrations (0.01-2000ng/ml) of each drugs for 4 and 72h to determine the sensitivities of the cells to each drug (IC50). The direct and indirect contact study of the anti-cancer biodegradable ureteral stents with the T24 and HUVEC cell lines confirmed the anti-tumoral effect of the BUS impregnated with the four anti-cancer drugs tested, reducing around 75% of the viability of the T24 cell line after 72h and demonstrating minimal cytotoxic effect on HUVECs.PMID: 27590380Title: Long-term survival outcomes of laparoscopic staging surgery in treating endometrial cancer: 20 years of follow-up.Authors: Lee CL, Kusunoki S, Huang KG, Wu KY, Huang CY, Yen CFSource: Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol. 2016 Aug;55(4):545-51. doi: 10.1016/j.tjog.2016.04.035.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic staging surgery (LSS) in treating patients with endometrial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who underwent LSS between June 1995 and June 2014 were prospectively registered. Perioperative data, complications, disease recurrence, and long-term survival were measured. RESULTS: The study included 287 consecutive patients [mean age (+/- standard deviation), 53+/-10.4 years; mean body mass index, 27.3+/-6.7 kg/m(2)] with a median follow-up ranging from 1 to 216 months. No laparotomy conversion was recorded for any patient. The mean operative time was 207+/-63.5 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 183+/-166.7 mL. The mean numbers of pelvic nodes and para-aortic nodes removed were 18+/-4.8 and 8+/-5, respectively. More than 80% of the patients had an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage 1 disease. The overall complication rate was 3.1%, including two patients of bladder injuries and one with bowel injury intraoperatively, and postoperatively one patient with pelvic abscess, three with urinary tract infection, one with voiding difficulty, and one with bowel perforation. The overall survival rates were 94% in 5 years and 92.7% in 20 years. No port-site metastasis was recorded in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endometrial carcinoma treated by LSS had compatible or even better long-term survival outcomes and less complication in comparison with the published data, in addition to the benefits of its minimally invasive characteristics. LSS should be the treatment of choice for endometrial cancer.PMID: 27590253Title: Early Stage Bladder Cancer - Do Pathology Reports Tell Us What We Need to Know?Authors: Schroeck FR, Pattison EA, Denhalter DW, Patterson OV, DuVall SL, Seigne JD, Robertson DJ, Sirovich B, Goodney PPSource: Urology. 2016 Aug 30. pii: S0090-4295(16)30544-1. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2016.07.040.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess a large national sample of bladder cancer pathology reports to determine if they contained the components necessary for clinical decision making. METHODS: We examined a random sample of 507 bladder cancer pathology reports from the national Veterans Administration (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse to assess whether each included information on the four report components explicitly recommended by the College of American Pathologists' protocol for the examination of such specimens: histology, grade, presence vs. absence of muscularis propria in the specimen, and microscopic extent. We then assessed variation in the proportion of reports lacking at least one component across VA facilities. RESULTS: 108 of 507 reports (21%) lacked at least one of the four components, with microscopic extent and presence vs. absence of muscularis propria in the specimen most commonly missing (each in 11% of reports). There was wide variation across facilities in the proportion of reports lacking at least one component, ranging from 0% to 80%. CONCLUSION: One fifth of bladder cancer pathology reports lack information needed for clinical decision making. The wide variation in incomplete report rates across facilities implies that some facilities already have implemented best practices assuring complete reporting while others have room for improvement. Future work to better understand barriers and facilitators of complete reporting may lead to interventions that improve bladder cancer care.PMID: 27590100Title: [Oncologic and perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy: A single-center prospective series].Authors: Alimi Q, Peyronnet B, Kammerer-Jacquet SF, Lefevre M, Gires B, Mathieu R, Tondut L, Vincendeau S, Manunta A, Rioux-Leclercq N, Guille F, Bensalah K, Verhoest GSource: Prog Urol. 2016 Sep;26(9):538-46. doi: 10.1016/j.purol.2016.07.003. Epub 2016 Aug 31.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to report perioperative and oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in a single-center series and to evaluate the impact of the experience on perioperative outcomes. METHODS: Between March 2012 and January 2016, 41 patients underwent RARC associated with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. All RARC included were performed by a single-surgeon in one center. Perioperative and oncological datas were collected prospectively. Recurrence-free (RFS), overall (OS) and cancer-specific survivals (CSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Method. The impact of the experience on perioperative data was estimated using Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: Mean age was 67,7years (+/-10.6). Most patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (73.2%). Mean operative time and mean estimated blood loss were respectively 319.5minutes (+/-85.3) and 662.5mL (+/-360.9). Eight patients needed perioperative blood transfusion (19.5%). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 3 cases (7.3%). Ileal neobladder was performed in 26.8% of the cases (54.5% being performed intracorporeal), and non-continent urinary diversion in 73.2%. Mean nodal yield was 17.7 (+/-9.3). Positive surgical margins were observed in 1 patient (2.3%). Mean length of stay was 13.2 days (+/-9.8). Postoperative complication rate was 46,3%. After a median follow-up of 16months, estimated 2 year-OS and CSS were respectively 62 and 76.1%. Estimated 2-year RFS was 67.6%. Perioperative outcomes improved with experience with a significant decrease in operative time (P=0.04) and a significant increase of nodal yield (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: In this single-center prospective study, satisfactory perioperative and oncological outcomes after RARC were observed despite the learning curve. Perioperative outcomes improved with surgeon's experience. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.PMID: 27589936Title: Perioperative change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predicts the overall survival of patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.Authors: Yoshida T, Kinoshita H, Yoshida K, Mishima T, Yanishi M, Komai Y, Sugi M, Murota T, Kawa G, Matsuda TSource: Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 2.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of perioperative changes in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 323 patients who had undergone radical cystectomy at our institutions. Overall survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios were significantly correlated with overall survival (both P = 0.0001). Changes in perioperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio stratified the patients into two groups, designated favorable- and poor-risk groups, with significantly different 5-year overall survival rates (75.1% and 41.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the perioperative change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval 1.75-3.73; P < 0.001). Moreover, a decrease in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio after adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with favorable overall survival in patients with high postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (P < 0.001), indicating that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio may be a predictive factor for the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative changes in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio are significantly associated with overall survival in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. Follow-up of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio change may be useful for the clinical management of patients after surgery.PMID: 27589904Title: Effect of Stage Migration on Bladder Cancer: A Slow but Steady Improvement in Long-Term Survival Rates After Radical Cystectomy in Previous 25 Years.Authors: Moschini M, Luzzago S, Cazzaniga W, Cucchiara V, Bandini M, Damiano R, Soria F, Klatte T, Shariat SF, Salonia A, Montorsi F, Briganti A, Colombo R, Gallina ASource: Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2016 Aug 8. pii: S1558-7673(16)30227-0. doi: 10.1016/j.clgc.2016.07.024.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of the year of surgery on the clinical, pathologic, and oncologic outcomes of patients with bladder cancer (BCa) treated with radical cystectomy (RC) at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 1253 consecutive patients with BCa treated with RC and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy at a single institution from January 1990 to December 2014. Analysis of variance and chi2 trend tests were used to report the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the cohort over time. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the relationship between the year of surgery and recurrence, cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM). RESULTS: Considering the clinical characteristics, patient age (P = .1) and gender (P = .2) remained steady during the study period. In contrast, the body mass index (P < .005) increased. Also, of the pathologic features, carcinoma in situ detection (P < .001) showed an increasing rate, and pathologic stage T3-T4 (P = .005) showed a decreasing trend. The number of lymph nodes removed increased during the study period (P < .001), resulting in an increased number of positive nodes (P < .001). However, the rate of lymph node invasion (P = .1) remained stable in the overall population. Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed the year of surgery as a predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97), CSM (HR, 0.97), and OM (HR, 0.98), with a slight, but constant, reduction in all survival outcomes (P < .04 for all). CONCLUSION: Changes were recorded considering the patient and tumor characteristics across the previous 25 years. These variations directly reflect the differences in long-term survival expectations we recorded.PMID: 27589558Title: Late intestinal obstruction after radical cystectomy and urinary diversion: urological and oncological perspectives.Authors: El-Hefnawy AS, Helmy T, Laimon M, El-Halwagy S, Abol-Enein HSource: Scand J Urol. 2016 Sep 2:1-6.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review different management modalities and outcome of patients presenting with late intestinal obstruction (IO) after radical cystectomy (RC) or palliative cystectomy (PC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Files of patients who presented with IO between January 1978 and June 2014 were reviewed. Patients who developed IO following either RC or PC more than 30 days after surgery were included. Patients' characteristics and management protocols were evaluated. Predictors for failure of conservative management and unfavorable outcome after surgical explorations were evaluated. Symptom-free and overall survival rates of patients with malignant IO was were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of IO was 2.8% after RC (118 out of 4199 patients) and 10% after PC (nine out of 87). Colonic diversions had the highest prevalence (6.2%), followed by ileal loop conduit (2.9%); the lowest prevalences followed Kock pouch and ileal W neobladder (1.7% and 1.6%, respectively). Postoperative urinary leakage from a ureteroenteric anastomosis was the only predictor for surgical intervention (p = 0.039). Nine cases had been explored for malignant obstruction (eight after RC and one after PC). The mean +/- SD elapsed time before death was 3.6 +/- 2 months (range 0.5-17 months). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary diversion with colonic segments carries more risk for the development of IO in comparison with ileal segments. Postoperative urinary leakage after cystectomy and urinary diversion may be a contributory factor for surgical exploration in cases with late IO.PMID: 27588391Title: Regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression and secretion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1).Authors: Endres M, Kneitz S, Orth MF, Perera RK, Zernecke A, Butt ESource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 31. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11720.Abstract: The process of tumor invasion requires degradation of extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes. Cancer cells form protrusive invadopodia, which produce and release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the basement membrane thereby enabling metastasis. We investigated the effect of LASP1, a newly identified protein in invadopodia, on expression, secretion and activation of MMPs in invasive breast tumor cell lines.By analyzing microarray data of in-house generated control and LASP1-depleted MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we observed downregulation of MMP1, -3 and -9 upon LASP1 depletion. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conversely, rescue experiments restored in part MMP expression and secretion. The regulatory effect of LASP1 on MMP expression was also observed in BT-20 breast cancer cells as well as in prostate and bladder cancer cell lines.In line with bioinformatic FunRich analysis of our data, which mapped a high regulation of transcription factors by LASP1, public microarray data analysis detected a correlation between high LASP1 expression and enhanced c-Fos levels, a protein that is part of the transcription factor AP-1 and known to regulate MMP expression. Compatibly, in luciferase reporter assays, AP-1 showed a decreased transcriptional activity after LASP1 knockdown.Zymography assays and Western blot analysis revealed an additional promotion of MMP secretion into the extracellular matrix by LASP1, thus, most likely, altering the microenvironment during cancer progression.The newly identified role of LASP1 in regulating matrix degradation by affecting MMP transcription and secretion elucidated the migratory potential of LASP1 overexpressing aggressive tumor cells in earlier studies.PMID: 27587270Title: Plan quality and dosimetric association of patient-reported rectal and urinary toxicities for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy.Authors: Qi XS, Wang JP, Gomez CL, Shao W, Xu X, King C, Low DA, Steinberg M, Kupelian PSource: Radiother Oncol. 2016 Aug 29. pii: S0167-8140(16)34255-4. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2016.08.012.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the association between dosimetric parameters with patient-reported quality-of-life (QOL) in urinary irritative/incontinency and bowel functions for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patient-reported QOL was evaluated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26). According to the progression in QOL score over 12months, patients were assigned to one of three subgroups: score decrement, no change, or increment. The dosimetric parameters were cross-compared among subgroups in urinary and bowel domains using univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The evaluated dosimetric metrics included target volume, V100 (volume receiving 100% prescription dose); rectal volume/dose-volume endpoints, maximum/mean doses; bladder volume/dose-volume endpoints, and maximum/mean doses. RESULTS: Patients with consistent QOL reduction in urinary irritation function were significantly associated with greater mean bladder dose, greater V85/V90/V95/V100 and D2cc/D10cc. Patients with QOL reduction in urinary incontinence were marginally associated with greater mean bladder dose (p=0.06). None of the evaluated dosimetric parameters showed a significant correlation with QOL score change in bowel function. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with large prostate size were more susceptible to QOL decrements for urinary irritative and incontinency functions. Large bladder V85/V90/V95/V100 was associated with QOL decrements in the urinary irritative domain at 1-year after prostate SBRT.PMID: 27586866Title: Theophylline controllable RNAi-based genetic switches regulate expression of lncRNA TINCR and malignant phenotypes in bladder cancer cells.Authors: Chen Z, Liu Y, He A, Li J, Chen M, Zhan Y, Lin J, Zhuang C, Liu L, Zhao G, Huang W, Cai ZSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 2;6:30798. doi: 10.1038/srep30798.Abstract: TINCR is a well-known lncRNA which acts as a master regulator in somatic differentiation development. However, it is still unclear whether TINCR is also involved in caner occurrence and progression. In this study, we observed that TINCR was up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and cells and contributed to oncogenesis and cancer progression. Silencing TINCR expression inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro, indicating that TINCR may be the potential therapeutic target for treating bladder urothelial carcinoma. Thus we used the synthetic biology approach to create theophylline controllable RNAi-based genetic switches which silenced TINCR in a dosage-dependent manner. Both RNAi-OFF and ON switches can be used to quantitatively control the expression of TINCR in bladder cancer to suppress the progression of bladder cancer. These findings suggest that lncRNA-TINCR could promote bladder cancer development and progression and artificial control of its expression through inducible RNAi may represent a new kind of therapeutic strategy for treating human bladder cancer.PMID: 27586786Title: Promoter hypermethylation of HS3ST2, SEPTIN9 and SLIT2 combined with FGFR3 mutations as a sensitive/specific urinary assay for diagnosis and surveillance in patients with low or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Authors: Roperch JP, Grandchamp B, Desgrandchamps F, Mongiat-Artus P, Ravery V, Ouzaid I, Roupret M, Phe V, Ciofu C, Tubach F, Cussenot O, Incitti RSource: BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 1;16:704. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2748-5.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a high incidence form of bladder cancer (BCa), where genetic and epigenetic alterations occur frequently. We assessed the performance of associating a FGFR3 mutation assay and a DNA methylation analysis to improve bladder cancer detection and to predict disease recurrence of NMIBC patients. METHODS: We used allele specific PCR to determine the FGFR3 mutation status for R248C, S249C, G372C, and Y375C. We preselected 18 candidate genes reported in the literature as being hypermethylated in cancer and measured their methylation levels by quantitative multiplex-methylation specific PCR. We selected HS3ST2, SLIT2 and SEPTIN9 as the most discriminative between control and NMIBC patients and we assayed these markers on urine DNA from a diagnostic study consisting of 167 NMIBC and 105 controls and a follow-up study consisting of 158 NMIBC at diagnosis time's and 425 at follow-up time. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each assay alone and in combination. RESULTS: For Diagnosis: Using a logistic regression analysis with a model consisting of the 3 markers' methylation values, FGFR3 status, age and known smoker status at the diagnosis time we obtained sensitivity/specificity of 97.6 %/84.8 % and an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.96. With an estimated BCa prevalence of 12.1 % in a hematuria cohort, this corresponds to a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.6 %. For Follow-up: Using a logistic regression with FGFR3 mutation and the CMI at two time points (beginning of the follow-up and current time point), we got sensitivity/specificity/NPV of 90.3 %/65.1 %/97.0 % and a corrected AUC of 0.84. We also tested a thresholding algorithm with FGFR3 mutation and the two time points as described above, obtaining sensitivity/specificity/NPV values of, respectively, 94.5 %/75.9 %/98.5 % and an AUC of 0.82. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that combined analysis of FGFR3 mutation and DNA methylation markers on urine can be a useful strategy in diagnosis, surveillance and for risk stratification of patients with NMIBC. These results provide the basis for a highly accurate noninvasive test for population screening and allowing to decrease the frequency of cystoscopy, an important feature for both patient quality of life improvement and care cost reduction.PMID: 27586407Title: Assessment of 10B concentration in boron neutron capture therapy: potential of image-guided therapy using 18FBPA PET.Authors: Shimosegawa E, Isohashi K, Naka S, Horitsugi G, Hatazawa JSource: Ann Nucl Med. 2016 Sep 1.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer, the accurate estimation of 10B tissue concentrations, especially in neighboring normal organs, is important to avoid adverse effects. The 10B concentration in normal organs after loading with 10B, however, has not been established in humans. In this study, we performed 4-borono-2-[18F]-fluoro-phenylalanine (18FBPA) PET in healthy volunteers and estimated the chronological changes in the 10B concentrations of normal organs. METHODS: In 6 healthy volunteers, whole-body 18FBPA PET scans were repeated 7 times during 1 h, and the mean 18FBPA distributions of 13 organs were measured. Based on the 18FBPA PET data, we then estimated the changes in the 10B concentrations of the organs when the injection of a therapeutic dose of 10BPA-fructose complex (10BPA-fr; 30 g, 500 mg/kg body weight) was assumed. RESULTS: The maximum mean 18FBPA concentrations were reached at 2-6 min after injection in all the organs except the brain and urinary bladder. The mean 18FBPA concentration in normal brain plateaued at 24 min after injection. When the injection of a therapeutic dose of 10BPA-fr was assumed, the estimated mean 10B concentration in the kidney increased to 126.1 +/- 24.2 ppm at 3 min after injection and then rapidly decreased to 30.9 +/- 7.4 ppm at 53 min. The estimated mean 10B concentration in the bladder gradually increased and reached 383.6 +/- 214.7 ppm at 51 min. The mean 10B concentration in the brain was estimated to be 7.6 +/- 1.5 ppm at 57 min. CONCLUSIONS: 18FBPA PET has a potential to estimate 10B concentration of normal organs before neutron irradiation of BNCT when several assumptions are validated in the future studies.PMID: 27586262Title: microRNA expression profiles as decision-making biomarkers in the management of bladder cancer.Authors: Amir S, Mabjeesh NJSource: Histol Histopathol. 2016 Sep 2:11814.Abstract: Bladder cancer (BC) is generally divided into non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BC (MIBC). The standard treatment protocol for MIBC patients is radical cystectomy preceded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). About one-half of the MIBC patients show a priori resistance to chemotherapy, and are therefore exposed to the risks of disease progression and toxicity from ineffective NAC. The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) regulation in tumorigenesis has provided new directions for the development of a new type of BC biomarkers. In this review, we describe the emerging miRNAs as BC biomarkers for different purposes, including diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response. miRNA expression profile changes with alteration of the tissue phenotype. This phenomenon is utilized to predict tumor diagnosis, cancer subclass, disease stage, prognosis and therapeutic response. We classified the miRNAs which are involved in bladder cancer according to malignant potential, chemoresistance, discrimination between normal to cancerous and clinical outcome. Focusing on the major obstacle regarding MIBC patient's NAC response, we summarized the miRNAs that are deregulated and have the potential to identify the patients resistant to NAC, such as miR-34, miR-100, miR-146b and miR-9 and miR-193a-3p. In conclusion, miRNAs expression profile of bladder cancer patient is a promising tool that can serve as biomarker for different aims. Based on this profile we propose upfront radical cystectomy instead of standard NAC to those MIBC patients who are at higher risk for chemoresistance and poor response.PMID: 27586132Title: 99mTc-zolmitriptan: radiolabeling, molecular modeling, biodistribution and gamma scintigraphy as a hopeful radiopharmaceutical for lung nuclear imaging.Authors: Rashed HM, Marzook FA, Farag HSource: Radiol Med. 2016 Sep 1.Abstract: Lung imaging radiopharmaceuticals are helpful agents for measuring pulmonary blood flow and allow detection of pulmonary embolism and lung cancer. The goal of this study was to develop a novel potential radiopharmaceutical for lung imaging. Zolmitriptan (a selective serotonin receptor agonist) was successfully labeled with 99mTc via direct labeling method under reductive conditions studying different factors affecting the labeling efficiency. 99mTc-zolmitriptan was obtained with a maximum labeling yield of 92.5 +/- 0.61 % and in vitro stability up to 24 h. Molecular modeling was done to predict the structure of 99mTc-zolmitriptan and ensure that radiolabeling did not affect binding ability of zolmitriptan to its receptor. Biodistribution studies showed that maximum lung uptake of 99mTc-zolmitriptan was 23.89 +/- 1.2 % injected dose/g tissue at 15 min post-injection and retention in lungs remained high up to 1 h, whereas the clearance from mice appeared to proceed mainly via the renal pathway. Scintigraphic images confirmed the biodistribution results showing a high resolution lung image with low accumulation of radioactivity in other organs except kidneys and urinary bladder. 99mTc-zolmitriptan is not a blood product and so it is more safe than the currently available 99mTc-MAA, and its lung uptake is higher than that of the recently discovered 123I-IPMPD, 99mTc(CO)5I and 99mTc-DHPM. So, 99mTc-zolmitriptan could be used as a hopeful radiopharmaceutical for lung scintigraphic imaging.PMID: 27585655Title: A Bregman-proximal point algorithm for robust non-negative matrix factorization with possible missing values and outliers - application to gene expression analysis.Authors: Chretien S, Guyeux C, Conesa B, Delage-Mouroux R, Jouvenot M, Huetz P, Descotes FSource: BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Aug 31;17 Suppl 8:284. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1120-8.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-Negative Matrix factorization has become an essential tool for feature extraction in a wide spectrum of applications. In the present work, our objective is to extend the applicability of the method to the case of missing and/or corrupted data due to outliers. RESULTS: An essential property for missing data imputation and detection of outliers is that the uncorrupted data matrix is low rank, i.e. has only a small number of degrees of freedom. We devise a new version of the Bregman proximal idea which preserves nonnegativity and mix it with the Augmented Lagrangian approach for simultaneous reconstruction of the features of interest and detection of the outliers using a sparsity promoting l 1 penality. CONCLUSIONS: An application to the analysis of gene expression data of patients with bladder cancer is finally proposed.PMID: 27585438Title: Severe Fournier's gangrene in a patient with rectal cancer: case report and literature review.Authors: Yoshino Y, Funahashi K, Okada R, Miura Y, Suzuki T, Koda T, Yoshida K, Koike J, Shiokawa H, Ushigome M, Kaneko T, Nagashima Y, Goto M, Kurihara A, Kaneko HSource: World J Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 1;14(1):234. doi: 10.1186/s12957-016-0989-z.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fournier's gangrene in the setting of rectal cancer is rare. Treatment for Fournier's gangrene associated with rectal cancer is more complex than other cases of Fournier's gangrene. We report on a patient with severe Fournier's gangrene in the setting of locally advanced rectal cancer who was treated with a combined modality therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man presented with general fatigue and anal pain. The medical and surgical histories were unremarkable. A black spot on the perineal skin surrounded by erythema was found on physical examination, suspicious for Fournier's gangrene. Computed tomography scan showed a rectal tumor invading into the bladder (clinically T4bN2M0) and abscess formation with emphysema around the rectum. He was thus diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and Fournier's gangrene with a severity index score of 12 points. We created a diverting loop colostomy of the transverse colon and performed extensive debridement of the perineum and perianal area. Fifty days later, the patient underwent radical total pelvic exenteration with sacrectomy. In addition, reconstruction of the soft tissue defect was performed using the rectus muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle, and the femoral muscle. Histopathological findings of the specimen were as follows: the tumor was a moderately adenocarcinoma with invasion to the bladder and the prostate (T4b), metastases to four resected lymph nodes (N2), and lymphovascular invasion. There were no major postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged 108 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of locally invasive rectal cancer associated with Fournier's gangrene. This case highlights a usual cause of Fournier's gangrene. Physicians should be cognizant not only of the more common condition but also of the rare presentations including those associated with rectal cancer.PMID: 27584025Title: Cancer immunotherapy: new applications in urologic oncology.Authors: Hurwitz ME, Sokhn J, Petrylak DPSource: Curr Opin Urol. 2016 Aug 31.Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last 10 years, harnessing of the immune system to attack tumors has been one of the major breakthroughs in cancer, primarily through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This review will summarize current immune treatments in urologic malignancies and ongoing trials with novel combinations and in different disease settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with urologic malignancies such as kidney and bladder cancer have benefited significantly from these advances with the approval of ICIs in both of these diseases. In addition, older immune therapies have also been used in these malignancies. For example, kidney cancers, which are traditionally unresponsive to chemotherapy, can respond to immune activation by cytokines. Prostate cancers, too, have immune therapies, such as sipuleucel-T, a dendritic cell vaccine. Combining ICIs with these older treatments as well as with molecularly targeted therapies and chemotherapies are currently underway. SUMMARY: The ICIs have changed the way urologic malignancies are treated and newer combinations are likely to alter the therapeutic landscape in these diseases dramatically in the coming years.PMID: 27584023Title: Cancer immunotherapy: new applications in urologic oncology.Authors: Mullane SA, Bellmunt JSource: Curr Opin Urol. 2016 Aug 31.Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immunotherapy in urological cancer has made substantial progress during the last 20 years, but recent advances in immunotherapy have completely transformed the present treatment landscape. In this review, we summarize major clinical achievements of immunotherapy in genitourinary cancers, as well as address potential new directions for these therapies, including new agents, combinations, and biomarkers. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, nivolumab and atezolizumab have joined sipuleucel-T as Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies in urological malignancies. Additional checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. Furthermore, significant work has been done exploring predictors of response to therapy. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy has changed the treatment of urologic malignancies. New immunotherapies and novel combinations will continue to create new treatment options in urologic tumors.PMID: 27583877Title: Urachal adenocarcinoma that metastasized to breast was misinterpreted as primary breast mucinous carcinoma: A rare case report and literature review.Authors: Zhao XR, Gao C, Zhang Y, Kong L, Qu W, Li J, Gao YS, Yu YHSource: Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Aug;95(35):e4612. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004612.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The urachus is a vestigial tubular structure that connects the urinary bladder to the allantois during early embryonic development. Urachal carcinoma develops in the urachus, which is an embryological remnant of the urogenital sinus and allantois. The estimated annual incidence of urachal carcinoma in the general population is 0.01% of all cancers in adults. Moreover, urachal carcinoma accounts for 0.34% to 0.7% of all bladder carcinoma cases. And breast metastasis is extremely rarer. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a palpable mass in the outer upper quadrant of the right breast, which was misinterpreted as a carcinoma that originated from the breast. Subsequently, she underwent surgery without any further meticulous examination. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed positivity for CK20, Villin, and CDX-2 and negativity for CK7. After further inspection, a mass was found in the bladder dome using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The mass was surgically removed. CONCLUSION: Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination confirmed that the mass was urachal mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma to the right breast. The patient has been followed up without recurrence for 8 months.PMID: 27583352Title: The hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism and susceptibility for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.Authors: Wenjuan C, Jianzhong L, Chong L, Yanjun G, Keqing L, Hanzhang W, Zhiping WSource: Int Braz J Urol. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2015.0446.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility of the hOGG1 genetic polymorphism for bladder cancer and evaluate the impact of smoking exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles included in PubMed, Medline and Springer databases were retrieved using the following key words: "human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosyl notase", "OGG", "OGG1", "hOGG1", "genetic variation", "polymorphism" , "bladder cancer", and "bladder carcinoma" to Meta-analysis was performed to detect whether there were differences between the bladder cancer group and the control group about the distribution of genotypes of the hOGG1 gene. RESULTS: The results showed that there are no significant associations between the hOGG1 326Cys polymorphism and bladder cancer: GG vs CC (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.85- 1.40, p=0.480); GC vs CC (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.85-1.28, p=0.662); GG+GC vs CC (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.89-1.21, p=0.619); GG vs GC+CC (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.78-1.33, p=0.888); G vs C (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.91-1.13, p=0.818). In the smoker population, no significant associations between the hOGG1 326Cys polymorphism and bladder cancer were observed for all the models. However, individuals carrying the hOGG1 Cys326Cys genotype have increased risk for bladder cancer compared to those carrying the hOGG1 Ser326Ser genotype in the non-smoker Asian population. CONCLUSION: The hOGG1 326Cys polymorphisms aren't a risk factor for bladder cancer, especially in the smoker population. But GG genotype is a risk factor for bladder cancer to the non-smoker Asian population compared with CC genotype.PMID: 26389218Title: Bladder and Other Urothelial Cancers Screening (PDQ(R)): Patient VersionAuthors: ?Source: ?Abstract: This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the screening of bladder and other urothelial cancers.

METHODS: We studied occurrence of first primary cancer among World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees through 2011 using adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), and the WTC-exposure-cancer association, using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: All-cancer SIR was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.20) in RRWs, and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.15) in non-RRWs. Prostate cancer and skin melanoma were significantly elevated in both populations. Thyroid cancer was significantly elevated only in RRWs while breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were significantly elevated only in non-RRWs. There was a significant exposure dose-response for bladder cancer among RRWs, and for skin melanoma among non-RRWs. CONCLUSIONS: We observed excesses of total and specific cancers in both populations, although the strength of the evidence for causal relationships to WTC exposures is somewhat limited. Continued monitoring of this population is indicated. Am. J. Ind. Med. 59:709-721, 2016.

Precision medicine using targeted therapy may improve survival. Here we investigated spatial and temporal tumour evolution and tumour heterogeneity in order to evaluate the potential use of targeted treatment of metastatic bladder cancer. We performed a proof-of-concept study by whole exome sequencing of multiple tumour regions (n = 22) from three patients with metastatic bladder cancer. DNA from primary and metastatic tumour biopsies was analysed for mutations using Mutect and potential therapeutic targets were identified. We identified 256, 265 and 378 somatic mutations per patient, encompassing mutations with an estimated functional impact in 6-12 known disease driver genes per patient. Disease driver mutations present in all tumour regions could be identified in all cases, however, over time metastasis specific driver mutations emerged. For each patient we identified 6-10 potentially therapeutic targets, however very few targets were present in all regions. Low mutational allele frequencies were observed in most regions suggesting a complex mixture of different cancer cells with no spatial demarcation of subclones. In conclusion, primary bladder tumours and metastatic lesions showed heterogeneity at the molecular level, but within the primary tumour the heterogeneity appeared low. The observed lack of potential therapeutic targets common to all cancer cells in primary tumours and metastases emphasizes the challenges in designing rational targeted therapy solely based on analysis of the primary tumours.PMID: 27581238Title: [S3 guideline for bladder cancer : Claim and reality - a critical commentary from the guideline coordinators].Authors: Retz M, Maisch P, Gschwend JESource: Urologe A. 2016 Sep;55(9):1188-91. doi: 10.1007/s00120-016-0196-0.Abstract: ?PMID: 27579449Title: Intra-tumour IgA1 is common in cancer and is correlated with poor prognosis in bladder cancer.Authors: Welinder C, Jirstrom K, Lehn S, Nodin B, Marko-Varga G, Blixt O, Danielsson L, Jansson BSource: Heliyon. 2016 Aug 16;2(8):e00143. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2016.e00143. eCollection 2016 Aug.Abstract: A high frequency of IgA1-positive tumour cells was found in tissue micro-arrays of oesophagus, colon, testis, lung, breast, bladder and ovarian cancer. IgA1 was observed in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. A correlation was found between intra-tumour IgA1 and poor overall survival in a large cohort of bladder cancer patients (n = 99, p = 0.011, log-rank test). The number of IgA1-positive tumour cells was also found to be higher in female than male bladder cancer patients. The presence of IgA1 was confirmed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ovarian carcinoma samples using LC-MS/MS analysis. Uptake of IgA1 was also observed in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines when cultivated in the presence of serum from healthy individuals, indicating a possible origin of the IgA1 antibodies in cancer cells.PMID: 27579421Title: Hexaminolevulinate Blue-Light Cystoscopy in a Patient with Metastatic Melanoma of the Bladder.Authors: Shukla A, Wingate JT, Baker KC, Brand TCSource: J Endourol Case Rep. 2016 Apr 1;2(1):68-70. doi: 10.1089/cren.2016.0031. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although bladder cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumors worldwide, metastatic melanoma of the bladder is a rare occurrence with only 29 cases reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 60-year-old male with a medical history significant for metastatic melanoma, who was referred to the urology department for gross hematuria. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed with the assistance of hexaminolevulinate acid (HAL) with blue-light cystoscopy (BLC). Subsequent histopathologic analysis of the specimen confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma of the bladder. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metastatic bladder melanoma diagnosed with the assistance of HAL-BLC in a patient undergoing a TURBT. CONCLUSION: Although HAL-BLC is only indicated for use in the cystoscopic detection of papillary nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, it may aid in the detection of nonconventional bladder pathologies, such as melanoma.PMID: 27579418Title: Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy and Ileal Neobladder for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer in Combination with One Stage Prophylactic Laparoscopic Sacrospinal Fixation to Avoid Future Pelvic Organ Prolapse.Authors: Torzsok P, Bauer S, Forstner R, Sievert KD, Janetschek G, Zimmermann RSource: J Endourol Case Rep. 2016 Mar 1;2(1):59-61. doi: 10.1089/cren.2016.0029. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Women who undergo cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder are more likely to have urinary retention and neocystocele mainly because of anatomical reasons than stress urinary incontinence. The risk is even higher in case of neurologic comorbidities, as in case of our patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a laparoscopic mesh insertion for sacrospinal colposuspension to prevent a neocystocele and pelvic organ prolapse in combination with laparoscopic radical cystectomy in a female patient suffering from bladder cancer and chronic episodic multiple sclerosis. After a 30-month follow-up, the patient is continent and voids without residual urine. A dynamic MR of the pelvis shows a minimal rectocele without any evidence of a cystocele. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cystectomy combined with sacrospinal mesh fixation is technically feasible and could be an option to prevent neocystocele for female patients.PMID: 27579408Title: Renal Papillary Necrosis Appearing as Bladder Cancer on Imaging.Authors: Dagrosa LM, Ghali F, Gormley EASource: J Endourol Case Rep. 2016 Feb 1;2(1):27-9. doi: 10.1089/cren.2016.0011. eCollection 2016.Abstract: A 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) presented with acute onset left lower quadrant pain, left-sided back pain, vomiting, and dysuria. Abdominopelvic CT scan revealed left hydroureteronephrosis to the level of the left ureterovesical junction (UVJ) where a bladder mass appeared to be obstructing the left ureteral orifice. The obstruction was ultimately found to be the result of a sloughed renal papilla lodged in the distal ureter, which created an inflammatory mass at the UVJ. Her history of diabetes and frequent UTIs likely predisposed her to the development of renal papillary necrosis (RPN) that resulted in sloughing of a renal papilla, distal ureteral obstruction with subsequent bladder inflammation that mimicked a bladder mass on imaging. RPN is a condition associated with many etiologies and likely represents a common final pathway of several diseases. Although several hypotheses exist, it is primarily thought to be ischemic in nature and is related to the underlying physiology of the renal papillae. We present a case of hydroureteronephrosis and bladder mass secondary to a sloughed renal papilla from RPN.PMID: 27578985Title: MiR-126 regulates proliferation and invasion in the bladder cancer BLS cell line by targeting the PIK3R2-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Authors: Xiao J, Lin HY, Zhu YY, Zhu YP, Chen LWSource: Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 22;9:5181-93. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S105198. eCollection 2016.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess whether microRNA-126 (miR-126) targets phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit beta (PIK3R2) and to determine the potential roles of miR-126 in regulating proliferation and invasion via the PIK3R2-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway in the human bladder BLS cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A recombinant lentivirus (Lv) vector expressing miR-216 (Lv-miR-126) was successfully constructed, and Lv-miR-126 and Lv vector were transfected into the BLS cell line. A direct regulatory relationship between miR-126 and the PIK3R2 gene was demonstrated by luciferase reporter assays. To determine whether PIK3R2 directly participates in the miR-126-induced effects in BLS cells, anti-miR-126 and a PIK3R2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were transfected into the BLS cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure miR-126 and PIK3R2 expressions. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine and colony formation assays to assess cell proliferation, flow cytometry for cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, Transwell assays for cell migration and invasion, and Western blots for PIK3R2, PI3K, phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K), Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) protein expressions were performed. RESULTS: Lv-miR-126 significantly enhanced the relative expression of miR-126 in the BLS cells after infection (P<0.0001). MiR-126 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, cloning, migration, and invasion of BLS cells, promoted cell apoptosis, and induced S phase arrest (all P<0.05). PIK3R2, p-PI3K, and p-Akt protein expressions were significantly decreased in the BLS cells infected with Lv-miR-126. Luciferase assays showed that miR-126 significantly inhibited the PIK3R2 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) luciferase reporter activity (P<0.05). The anti-miR-126 + PIK3R2 siRNA group had significantly decreased PIK3R2, p-PI3K, and p-Akt expressions compared with those of anti-miR-126 alone, as well as significantly decreased proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and increased apoptosis compared with the anti-miR-126 group (all P<0.05). Additionally, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis were significantly increased, and cell apoptosis was decreased compared with the PIK3R2 siRNA group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of miR-126 negatively regulated the target gene PIK3R2 and further inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoting apoptosis in BLS cells.PMID: 27578615Title: Identifying significant gene-environment interactions using a combination of screening testing and hierarchical false discovery rate control.Authors: Frost HR, Shen L, Saykin AJ, Williams SM, Moore JHSource: Genet Epidemiol. 2016 Aug 31. doi: 10.1002/gepi.21997.Abstract: Although gene-environment (Gx E) interactions play an important role in many biological systems, detecting these interactions within genome-wide data can be challenging due to the loss in statistical power incurred by multiple hypothesis correction. To address the challenge of poor power and the limitations of existing multistage methods, we recently developed a screening-testing approach for Gx E interaction detection that combines elastic net penalized regression with joint estimation to support a single omnibus test for the presence of Gx E interactions. In our original work on this technique, however, we did not assess type I error control or power and evaluated the method using just a single, small bladder cancer data set. In this paper, we extend the original method in two important directions and provide a more rigorous performance evaluation. First, we introduce a hierarchical false discovery rate approach to formally assess the significance of individual Gx E interactions. Second, to support the analysis of truly genome-wide data sets, we incorporate a score statistic-based prescreening step to reduce the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms prior to fitting the first stage penalized regression model. To assess the statistical properties of our method, we compare the type I error rate and statistical power of our approach with competing techniques using both simple simulation designs as well as designs based on real disease architectures. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify biologically plausible SNP-education interactions relative to Alzheimer's disease status using genome-wide association study data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).PMID: 27578233Title: Optimised photodynamic diagnosis for transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in German clinical practice: results of the noninterventional study OPTIC III.Authors: Bach T, Bastian PJ, Blana A, Kaminsky A, Keller S, Knoll T, Lang C, Promnitz S, Ubrig B, Keller T, Qvick B, Burger MSource: World J Urol. 2016 Aug 30.Abstract: PURPOSE: White light cystoscopy (WLC) is the standard procedure for visualising non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, WLC can fail to detect all cancerous lesions, and outcomes with transurethral resection of the bladder differ between institutions, controlled trials, and possibly between trials and routine application. This noninterventional study assessed the benefit of hexaminolevulinate blue light cystoscopy (HALC; Hexvix(R), Ipsen Pharma GmbH, Germany) plus WLC versus WLC alone in routine use. METHODS: From May 2013 to April 2014, 403 patients with suspected NMIBC were screened from 30 German centres to perform an unprecedented detailed assessment of the additional detection of cancer lesions with HALC versus WLC alone. RESULTS: Among the histological results for 929 biopsy samples, 94.3 % were obtained from suspected cancerous lesions under either WLC or HALC: 59.5 % were carcinoma tissue and 40.5 % were non-cancerous tissue. Of all cancer lesions, 62.2 % were staged as Ta, 20.1 % as T1, 9.3 % as T2, 7.3 % as carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 1.2 % were unknown. Additional cancer lesions (+6.8 %) and CIS lesions (+25 %, p < 0.0001) were detected by HALC plus WLC versus WLC alone. In 10.0 % of patients, >/=1 additional positive lesion was detected with HALC, and 2.2 % of NMIBC patients would have been missed with WLC alone. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that HALC significantly improves the detection of NMIBC versus WLC alone in routine clinical practice in Germany. While this benefit is statistically significant across all types of NMIBC, it seems most relevant in CIS.PMID: 27578166Title: Clinical significance of CDH13 promoter methylation as a biomarker for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.Authors: Chen F, Huang T, Ren Y, Wei J, Lou Z, Wang X, Fan X, Chen Y, Weng G, Yao XSource: BMC Urol. 2016 Aug 30;16(1):52. doi: 10.1186/s12894-016-0171-5.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Methylation of the tumor suppressor gene H-cadherin (CDH13) has been reported in many cancers. However, the clinical effect of the CDH13 methylation status of patients with bladder cancer remains to be clarified. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify eligible studies in the PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, CKNI and Wanfang databases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was calculated and summarized. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies were included in the present meta-analysis consisting of a total of 1017 bladder cancer patients and 265 non-tumor controls. A significant association was found between CDH13 methylation levels and bladder cancer (OR = 21.71, P < 0.001). The results of subgroup analyses based on sample type suggested that CDH13 methylation was significantly associated with bladder cancer risk in both the tissue and the urine (OR = 53.94, P < 0.001; OR = 7.71, P < 0.001; respectively). A subgroup analysis based on ethnic population showed that the OR value of methylated CDH13 was higher in Asians than in Caucasians (OR = 35.18, P < 0.001; OR = 8.86, P < 0.001; respectively). The relationships between CDH13 methylation and clinicopathological features were also analyzed. A significant association was not observed between CDH13 methylation status and gender (P = 0.053). Our results revealed that CDH13 methylation was significantly associated with high-grade bladder cancer, multiple bladder cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer (OR = 2.22, P < 0.001; OR = 1.45, P = 0.032; OR = 3.42, P < 0.001; respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that CDH13 methylation may play an important role in the carcinogenesis, development and progression of bladder cancer. In addition, CDH13 methylation has the potential to be a useful biomarker for bladder cancer screening in urine samples and to be a prognostic biomarker in the clinic.PMID: 27578042Title: Bladder cancer: Low adherence to guidelines in non-muscle-invasive disease.Authors: van Rhijn BW, Burger MSource: Nat Rev Urol. 2016 Aug 31. doi: 10.1038/nrurol.2016.165.Abstract: ?PMID: 27577949Title: MicroRNA-3713 regulates bladder cell invasion via MMP9.Authors: Wu WB, Wang W, Du YH, Li H, Xia SJ, Liu HTSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 31;6:32374. doi: 10.1038/srep32374.Abstract: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common type of bladder cancer but its carcinogenesis remains not completely elucidated. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is well known to be involved in the development of various cancers, including TCC, whereas a role of miR-3713 in the pathogenesis of TCC has not been appreciated. Here, we reported that significantly higher levels of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and significantly lower levels of miR-3713 were detected in TCC tissue, compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissue, and were inversely correlated. Moreover, the low miR-3713 levels in TCC specimens were associated with poor survival of the patients. In vitro, overexpression of miR-3713 significantly decreased cell invasion, and depletion of miR-3713 increased cell invasion in TCC cells. The effects of miR-3713 on TCC cell growth appeared to result from its modification of MMP9 levels, in which miR-3713 was found to bind to the 3'-UTR of MMP9 mRNA to inhibit its protein translation in TCC cells. This study highlights miR-3713 as a previously unrecognized factor that controls TCC invasiveness, which may be important for developing innovative therapeutic targets for TCC treatment.PMID: 27576884Title: The Prevalence and Prognostic Significance of Polyomavirus Infection in Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.Authors: Wu SW, Liou JH, Yeh KT, Hung TW, Chang HRSource: Urol J. 2016 Aug 25;13(4):2773-8.Abstract: PURPOSE: Human polyomaviruses (PV) has been associated with oncogenicity; however, the association between human bladder cancer and PV remains inconclusive. Moreover, whether PV has the interaction with p53 in tumorigenesis and their prognostic significance on human bladder cancer has yet to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder tumor specimens and clinical parameters from 74 patients with urothelial carcinoma were collected. Immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to PV large tumor antigen (TAg) and p53 protein was performed to investigate the involvement of PV in human bladder tumorigenesis and the prognostic significance of TAg and p53 expressions using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The mean age of the 74 patients at diagnosis was 64 years and 61 (82.4%) were male. The expression of PV TAg protein was found in 45 (60.8%) tumor samples, but was not correlated with the expression of p53 (P = .280). The detection of PV TAg was significantly associated with tumor stage (P = .001) but not decreased overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) (P = .661 and .738, respectively). However, the p53 overexpression was significantly associated with decreased CSS (P = .028). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, age and p53 overexpression were predictors of OS (P = .026) independently of tumor stage and CSS (P = .042), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found that PV, which was detected in a significant percentage of tumor specimens, may be an important co-factor in the tumorigenesis of the bladder in humans. However, only p53 overexpression was associated with predicting CSS independently of tumor stage.&nbsp.PMID: 27576595Title: Outcomes of seromuscular bladder augmentation versus standard ileocystoplasty: A single institution experience over 14 years.Authors: Odeh RI, Farhat WA, Penna FJ, Koyle MA, Lee LC, Butt H, Alyami FASource: J Pediatr Urol. 2016 Aug 3. pii: S1477-5131(16)30199-1. doi: 10.1016/j.jpurol.2016.05.046.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ileocystoplasty is the standard technique used for bladder augmentation, and has been used widely for decades. However, it is known to be associated with complications such as stone formation, mucus production, metabolic acidosis, urinary tract infections, intestinal obstruction, and a long-term risk of bladder cancer. Seromuscular bladder augmentation (SMBA) is an alternative to the standard ileocystoplasty, and has been associated with a lower incidence of bladder stones. Few reports have been published on intermediate outcomes of SMBA. Herein, we report long-term outcomes of SMBA from a single institution compared with standard ileocystoplasty. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent bladder augmentation at our institution over a 14-year period was performed. The status of patients after SMBA (10 patients) was compared according to age, sex, and diagnosis with patients who underwent traditional ileocystoplasty (30 patients). Parameters such as demographic information, pre- and postoperative bladder capacity as assessed by urodynamic studies, urinary tract infections (UTIs), bladder calculi, incontinence, need for secondary surgical procedures, and spontaneous bladder perforation were compared in the two groups. All the patients were on a clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) regimen. RESULTS: Over the study period, 10 patients underwent SMBA and 30 patients (according to age, sex, and diagnosis) underwent standard ileocystoplasty; the average age at surgery was 10.3 and 10 years respectively, with a mean follow up of 6.7 years in the SMBA group and 6 years in the ileocystoplasty group. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of UTIs, urinary incontinence, subsequent surgery, or spontaneous bladder perforation. The mean bladder capacity increased significantly for both groups as assessed by pre- and postoperative urodynamic studies, although the difference in the rate of bladder calculi between the two groups (0 [0%] vs. 8 [27%], p = 0.06) did not reach statistical significance (Table). CONCLUSIONS: SMBA is safe and efficacious and may result in a lower rate of stone formation than standard ileocystoscopy. SMBA should be considered as a viable alternative to standard ileocystoplasty.PMID: 27576342Title: Interplay between intergrin-linked kinase and ribonuclease inhibitor affects growth and metastasis of bladder cancer through signaling ILK pathways.Authors: Zhuang X, Lv M, Zhong Z, Zhang L, Jiang R, Chen JSource: J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 30;35(1):130. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0408-x.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multifunctional adaptor protein which is involved with protein signalling within cells to modulate malignant (cancer) cell movement, cell cycle, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our previous experiment demonstrated that ILK siRNA inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of bladder cancer cells as well as increased the expression of Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), an important cytoplasmic protein with many functions. We also reported that RI overexpression inhibited ILK and phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3beta. ILK and RI gene both locate on chromosome 11p15 and the two genes are always at the adjacent position of same chromosome during evolution, which suggest that ILK and RI could have some relationship. However, underlying interacting mechanisms remain unclear between them. Here, we postulate that RI might regulate ILK signaling pathway via interacting with ILK. METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and co-localization under laser confocal microscope assay were used to determine the interaction between ILK and RI exogenously and endogenously. Furthermore, we further verified that there is a direct binding between the two proteins by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in cells. Next, The effects of interplay between ILK and RI on the key target protein expressions of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were determined by western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay in vivo and in vitro. Finally, the interaction was assessed using nude mice xenograft model. RESULTS: We first found that ILK could combine with RI both in vivo and in vitro by GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and FRET. The protein levels of ILK and RI revealed a significant inverse correlation in vivo and in vitro. Subsequently, The results showed that up-regulating ILK could increase cell proliferation, change cell morphology and regulate cell cycle. We also demonstrated that the overexpression of ILK remarkably promoted EMT and expressions of target molecules of ILK signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we found that ILK overexpression significantly enhanced growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of xenograft tumor; Whereas, RI has a contrary role compared to ILK in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, for the first time, directly proved that the interplay between ILK and RI regulated EMT via ILK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways for bladder cancer, which highlights the possibilities that ILK/RI could be valuable markers together for the therapy and diagnosis of human carcinoma of urinary bladder.PMID: 27574450Title: MiR-200c promotes bladder cancer cell migration and invasion by directly targeting RECK.Authors: Cheng Y, Zhang X, Li P, Yang C, Tang J, Deng X, Yang X, Tao J, Lu Q, Li PSource: Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 16;9:5091-9. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S101067. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that the dysregulation of certain microRNAs plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. MiR-200c exhibits a disordered expression in many tumors and presents dual roles in bladder cancer (BC). Therefore, the definite role of miR-200c in BC needs to be investigated further. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess miR-200c expression. Cell invasion and migration were evaluated using wound healing and transwell assays. The luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the direct target of miR-200c. The expression of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) in BC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues, as well as in BC cell lines, was detected through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot assay, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The miR-200c expression was significantly upregulated in the BC tissues compared with the adjacent nontumor tissues. The downregulation of miR-200c significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in the BC cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay showed that RECK was a direct target of miR-200c. The knockdown of RECK in the BC cell lines treated with anti-miR-200c elevated the previously attenuated cell migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that miR-200c functions as oncogenes in BC and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BC.PMID: 27574444Title: PD-L1 expression in human cancers and its association with clinical outcomes.Authors: Wang X, Teng F, Kong L, Yu JSource: Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 12;9:5023-39. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S105862. eCollection 2016.Abstract: PD-L1 is an immunoinhibitory molecule that suppresses the activation of T cells, leading to the progression of tumors. Overexpression of PD-L1 in cancers such as gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In contrast, PD-L1 expression correlates with better clinical outcomes in breast cancer and merkel cell carcinoma. The prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma is controversial. Blocking antibodies that target PD-1 and PD-L1 have achieved remarkable response rates in cancer patients who have PD-L1-overexpressing tumors. However, using PD-L1 as an exclusive predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy is questionable due to the low accuracy of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining. Factors that affect the accuracy of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining are as follows. First, antibodies used in different studies have different sensitivity. Second, in different studies, the cut-off value of PD-L1 staining positivity is different. Third, PD-L1 expression in tumors is not uniform, and sampling time and location may affect the results of PD-L1 staining. Therefore, better understanding of tumor microenvironment and use of other biomarkers such as gene marker and combined index are necessary to better identify patients who will benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy.PMID: 27573985Title: Clinical significance of alpha and betaKlotho in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.Authors: Hori S, Miyake M, Onishi S, Tatsumi Y, Morizawa Y, Nakai Y, Anai S, Tanaka N, Fujimoto KSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Oct;36(4):2117-25. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5053. Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for ~70% of all bladder cancers. One of the serious clinical issues related to the management of NMIBC is that it has significant potential to progress to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) after initial treatments. alphaKlotho (KLalpha), originally identified as an antiaging gene, has recently been reported to have antitumor effects in various malignancies. In contrast, betaKlotho (KLbeta) has been reported to have protumoral functions. However, the associations between KLalpha/KLbeta and the biological behavior of urothelial carcinoma remain unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the association between clinicopathological background factors of NMIBC and the expression levels of KLalpha or KLbeta. A high expression level of KLbeta, but not KLalpha, was an independent predictive factor of short progressionfree survival for NMIBC. An elevated level of KLbeta correlated with a higher incidence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI). We added in vitro assays using human bladder cancer cell lines to investigate the role of KLbeta. Treatment with exogenous KLbeta protein increased the proliferation, migration, transendothelial migration abilities and anchorageindependent growth of the cell lines. In addition, the KLbeta concentration in voided urine samples obtained before initial transurethral surgery was quantitated with enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The urine KLbeta concentration was found to be higher in patients with bladder cancer than that in healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that KLbeta plays important roles in tumor invasion and progression, and its concentration may be a valuable urinebased marker for the detection of bladder cancer.PMID: 27573859Title: MicroRNA-892b influences proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by mediating the p19ARF/cyclin D1/CDK6 and Sp-1/MMP-9 pathways.Authors: Shin SS, Park SS, Hwang B, Moon B, Kim WT, Kim WJ, Moon SKSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Oct;36(4):2313-20. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5052. Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: Cancers often utilize microRNAs to suppress tumor suppressor genes, thus facilitating their potential for growth and invasion. In the present study, we report the novel findings that miR-892b inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. The basal expression level of miR892b was significantly lower in 3 different bladder cancer cell lines than in normal human urothelial cells. Transfection of miR-892b mimics to bladder cancer cells resulted in dosedependent growth arrest. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle showed that miR-892b-transfected bladder cancer cells were subject to arrest in the G1 phase, which was due to the downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK6 followed by upregulation of p19ARF. In addition, overexpression of miR-892b impeded the migration and invasion of EJ cells. Expression of MMP-9 in EJ cells was blocked by transfection of miR-892b; the effect was regulated, at least in part, by activation of the Sp-1 transcription factor. Overall, we verified that miR-892b regulates the p19ARF/cyclin D1/CDK6 and Sp-1/MMP-9 signaling networks in bladder cancer cells and may provide a treatment option for advanced-stage bladder cancers.PMID: 27573550Title: miR-194 is a negative regulator of GEF-H1 pathway in melanoma.Authors: Guo B, Hui Q, Zhang Y, Chang P, Tao KSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Oct;36(4):2412-20. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5020. Epub 2016 Aug 12.Abstract: The incidence and associated mortality of melanoma continues to increase worldwide. At present, there is no curative therapy for advanced stage of melanoma. It is necessary to find new indicators of prognosis and therapeutic targets. Increasing evidence shows that miRNA can provide potential candidate biomarkers for melanoma and therapeutic targets. GEF-H1, a regulator of RhoA, as oncogenic driver in melanoma, promotes the growth and invasion of melanoma. miR-194 is a tumor-suppressor gene in multiple tumors, such as bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, we demonstrated that GEF-H1 serves as target of miR-194. Overexpression of miR-194 downregulates the GEF-H1/RhoA pathway, inhibits melanoma cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-194 expression is negatively associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages. Briefly, our findings provided new theoretical basis for melanoma treatment.PMID: 27571890Title: Baicalein induces apoptosis via ROS-dependent activation of caspases in human bladder cancer 5637 cells.Authors: Choi EO, Park C, Hwang HJ, Hong SH, Kim GY, Cho EJ, Kim WJ, Choi YHSource: Int J Oncol. 2016 Sep;49(3):1009-18. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3606. Epub 2016 Jul 6.Abstract: Baicalein is a flavonoid derived originally from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which has been used in Oriental medicines for treating various diseases. Although this compound has been reported to have anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines, the therapeutic effects of baicalein on human bladder cancer and its mechanisms of action have not been extensively studied. This study investigated the proapoptotic effects of baicalein in human bladder cancer 5637 cells. For this study, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and flow cytometry. Measurements of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase activity assays and western blots were conducted to determine whether 5637 cell death occurred by apoptosis. Treatment with baicalein resulted in a concentration-dependent growth inhibition coupled with apoptosis induction, as indicated by the results of nuclei morphology examination and flow cytometry analyses. The induction of the apoptotic cell death of 5637 cells by baicalein exhibited a correlation with the downregulation of members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, including cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, and the activation of caspase-9 and -3 accompanied by proteolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase. The study also showed that baicalein decreases the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, increases antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression, and noticeably aggravates the loss of MMP. Concomitantly, the data showed that baicalein increases the levels of death receptors and their associated ligands and enhances the activation of caspase-8 and truncation of Bid. However, the pan-caspase inhibitor can reverse baicalein-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that it is a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, it was found that baicalein can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly attenuates the baicalein effects on the loss of MMP and activation of caspase. In addition, the blocking of ROS generation decreases the apoptotic activity and antiproliferative effect of baicalein, indicating that baicalein induces apoptosis of 5637 cells through the ROS-dependent activation of caspases.PMID: 27571748Title: miR-451 suppresses bladder cancer cell migration and invasion via directly targeting c-Myc.Authors: Wang J, Zhao X, Shi J, Pan Y, Chen Q, Leng P, Wang YSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Oct;36(4):2049-58. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5040. Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: MicroRNA (miRNA) expression is shown dysregulated in tumors. It has been reported that miR-451 alters gene expression and regulates tumorigenesis in various cancer tissues. However, its underlying biological significance in bladder cancer remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the function and molecular mechanism of miR-451 involved in bladder cancer cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that miR-451 was downregulated in clinical bladder carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent bladder tissues. Overexpression of miR-451 significantly retarded the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells in vitro. Moreover, the attenuated cell migration and invasion by miR-451 was correlated with increased apoptosis. However, our dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that c-Myc, an oncogene in many tumors, was a direct target gene of miR-451 in bladder cancer. The expression of c-Myc was repressed by miR-451 in bladder cancer cells, and knockdown of c-Myc mimicked the effects of miR-451 overexpression. This discovery suggested that miR-451 is a tumor suppressor modulating bladder cancer cell migration and invasion by directly targeting c-Myc. In addition, apoptosis promoted by miR-451 may participates in this biological behavior. Therefore, target miR-451 may be a novel therapeutic intervention for bladder cancer.PMID: 27570977Title: Vitamin K2 Induces Mitochondria-Related Apoptosis in Human Bladder Cancer Cells via ROS and JNK/p38 MAPK Signal Pathways.Authors: Duan F, Yu Y, Guan R, Xu Z, Liang H, Hong LSource: PLoS One. 2016 Aug 29;11(8):e0161886. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161886. eCollection 2016.Abstract: The effects of vitamin K2 on apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells have been well established in previous studies. However, the apoptotic effect of vitamin K2 on bladder cancer cells has not been evaluated. The aim of this study is to examine the apoptotic activity of Vitamin K2 in bladder cancer cells and investigate the underlying mechanism. In this study, Vitamin K2 induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells through mitochondria pathway including loss of mitochondria membrane potential, cytochrome C release and caspase-3 cascade. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK was detected in Vitamin K2-treated cells and both SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) and SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK) completely abolished the Vitamin K2-induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondria membrane potential. Moreover, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in bladder cancer cells, upon treatment of vitamin K2 and the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) almost blocked the Vitamin K2-triggered apoptosis, loss of mitochondria membrane potential and activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these findings revealed that Vitamin K2 induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via ROS-mediated JNK/p38 MAPK and Mitochondrial pathways.PMID: 27570750Title: Metformin for the Prevention of Bladder Cancer Recurrence: Is it Effective?Authors: Heidari F, Abbas Zade S, Mir Hosseini SH, Ghadian ASource: Nephrourol Mon. 2016 Mar 19;8(3):e30261. doi: 10.5812/numonthly.30261. eCollection 2016 May.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many methods have been used for preventing and reducing recurrences of bladder cancers. In recent years, some investigators have examined the use of metformin for this purpose. First lines of evidence have shown that metformin inhibits cancer cell growth and prevents cancer occurrence in patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVES: This study is designed to assess metformin usage in the prevention of bladder cancer recurrence after the trans-urethral resection of a bladder tumor (TUR-T). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, metformin was administered in the treatment of 32 patients with a history of bladder cancer, and their results were compared with those of 33 patients with bladder cancer recurrence (placebo group). Patients in the metformin group received 1000 mg metformin (2 tablets 500 mg) for 1 year. Frequency of tumor recurrence was calculated and compared with the placebo group. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups with respect to the recurrence rate (P > 0.05). Although the recurrence interval was longer for the metformin group, this increase was not statistical significant (P > 0.05). Furthermore, tumor recurrence had no correlation with sex or the grade of the tumors. CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, it seems that metformin has no considerable inhibitory effect on the recurrence rate of bladder cancer, but that it can delay tumor recurrence.PMID: 27570122Title: Bladder spatial-dose descriptors correlate with acute urinary toxicity after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.Authors: Improta I, Palorini F, Cozzarini C, Rancati T, Avuzzi B, Franco P, Degli Esposti C, Del Mastro E, Girelli G, Iotti C, Vavassori V, Valdagni R, Fiorino CSource: Phys Med. 2016 Aug 25. pii: S1120-1797(16)30900-0. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmp.2016.08.013.Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess bladder spatial-dose parameters predicting acute urinary toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa) through a pixel-wise method for analysis of bladder dose-surface maps (DSMs). MATERIALS & METHODS: The final cohort of a multi-institutional study, consisting of 539 patients with PCa treated with conventionally (CONV:1.8-2Gy/fr) or moderately hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HYPO:2.2-2.7Gy/fr) was considered. Urinary toxicity was evaluated through the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) administered before and after radiotherapy. IPSS increases 10 and 15 points at the end of radiotherapy (DeltaIPSS10 and DeltaIPSS15) were chosen as endpoints. Average DSMs (corrected into 2Gy-equivalent doses) of patients with/without toxicity were compared through a pixel-wise method. This allowed the extraction of selected spatial descriptors discriminating between patients with/without toxicity. Previously logistic models based on dose-surface histograms (DSH) were considered and replaced with DSM descriptors. Discrimination power, calibration and log-likelihood were considered to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of spatial descriptors. RESULTS: Data of 375/539 patients were available. DeltaIPSS10 was recorded in 76/375 (20%) patients, while 30/375 (8%) experienced DeltaIPSS15. The posterior dose at 12mm from the bladder base (roughly corresponding to the trigone region) resulted significantly associated to toxicity in the whole/HYPO populations. The cranial extension of the 75Gy isodose along the bladder central axis was the best DSM-based predictor in CONV patients. Multi-variable models including DSM descriptors showed better discrimination (AUC=0.66-0.77) when compared to DSH-based models (AUC=0.58-0.71) and higher log-likelihoods. CONCLUSION: DSMs are correlated with the risk of acute GU toxicity. The incorporation of spatial descriptors improves discrimination and log-likelihood of multi-variable models including dosimetric and clinical parameters.PMID: 27569436Title: Clinico-pathological features and prognostic value of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in radical cysto-prostatectomy specimens: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13140 patients.Authors: Fahmy O, Khairul-Asri MG, Schubert T, Renninger M, Stenzl A, Gakis GSource: J Urol. 2016 Aug 25. pii: S0022-5347(16)31143-0. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2016.08.088.Abstract: PURPOSE: There is controversy in literature about the oncological significance of incidental prostate cancer (IPC) detected at radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) for bladder cancer (BC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online search was conducted for studies reporting on IPC in cystoprostatectomy specimens. After following the PRISMA guidelines, a total of 34 reports containing 13140 patients who underwent RCP for BC with no previous history of prostate cancer were identified. A cumulative analysis was conducted for the available data regarding the prevalence, the clinicopathological features, and the oncological outcomes. RevMan vesion 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis of data. RESULTS: Of the 13140 patients, IPC was detected in 3335 (24.4%). IPC was significantly associated with higher age (Z=3.81; p=0.0001; d=0.27; 95%CI -0.14-0.68), lymphovascular invasion of bladder cancer (Z=2.07; p=0.04, r=0.14; 95%CI 0.09-0.18), and lower 5-year overall survival (Z = 2.2; p = 0.03). Among patients with clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancer, those with clinically significant PC displayed significantly more frequent a positive finding on digital rectal examination (Z=3.12; p=0.002; r=0.10; 95%CI 0-0.19), and lower 5-year overall survival (Z = 2.49; p = 0.01) whereas no effect of age was observed (p=0.15). In 1320 patients monitored for biochemical recurrence, 25 patients (1.9%) developed PSA recurrence >0.02 ng/ml in a time interval ranging between 3-102 months. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that IPC detected during histopathological examination of RCP specimens might be linked with adverse characteristics and outcomes of patients with invasive bladder cancer.PMID: 27569360Title: [Liposarcoma of the Spermatic Cord : A Case Report and Review of the Literature].Authors: Yoshino T, Wake K, Yamamoto T, Onuma H, Kawakami KSource: Hinyokika Kiyo. 2016 Jul;62(7):393-7. doi: 10.14989/ActaUrolJap_62_7_393.Abstract: A 92-year-old man had noticed enlargement of a mass in the right scrotum and inguinal region for nine months. The patient was introduced to our department for right testicular tumor. Physical examination showed an over fist-sized, hard mass in the right scrotum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the mass, which consisted of fatty and solid contents. In addition, MRI revealed a bladder tumor simultaneously. Computed tomography revealed no distant metastases. The patient underwent right high orchiectomy with the mass resection and transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Pathological examination revealed well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the right spermatic cord, and urothelial cancer of the bladder. Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is a rare neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, the present case was the 114 th reported case and oldest in Japan.PMID: 27569354Title: [Severe Hyponatremia after Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy : Two Case Reports].Authors: Ohtaka M, Hattori Y, Kumano Y, Maeda Y, Kondo T, Mochizuki T, Kawahara T, Teranishi J, Miyoshi Y, Yumura Y, Uemura HSource: Hinyokika Kiyo. 2016 Jul;62(7):361-6. doi: 10.14989/ActaUrolJap_62_7_361.Abstract: Hyponatremia is one of the common electrolyte disorders associated with cisplatin (CDDP) administration. We report here two cases of hyponatremia associated with CDDP. Case 1 : A 75-year-old man with urothelial carcinoma of bladder (cT3N1M0) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP and gemcitabine. He lost consciousness on the eighth day after the chemotherapy. Blood tests showed severe hyponatremia (Na 113 mEq/l), low plasma osmolality and high level of plasma vasopressin. Urine tests showed low osmolality. These findings were consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). His consciousness level was improved after saline infusion and fluid restriction. Case 2 : A 54-year-old man with penile cancer (cT3N2M0) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP, paclitaxel and fluorouracil. He lost consciousness on the seventh day after the chemotherapy. Blood tests showed hyponatremia(Na 121 mEq/l) with renal dysfunction. We concluded that the hyponatremia is due to the renal salt wasting syndrome (RSWS) based on renal dysfunction and high urinary sodium excretion. His consciousness level was improved after saline infusion. Although it is difficult to distinguish between SIADH and RSWS, correct evaluation is necessary for appropriate management of hyponatremia after CDDP administration.PMID: 27569040Title: Biennial report on genitourinary cancers.Authors: Fizazi KSource: Eur J Cancer. 2016 Oct;66:125-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2016.06.026. Epub 2016 Aug 26.Abstract: The last 2 years (2014 and 2015) have witnessed major advances in the treatment of genitourinary malignancies. Of note and in marked contrast to previous years, all four major cancers (prostate cancer, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer) have benefited from this progress. In prostate cancer, it was clearly demonstrated that a local treatment should be administered for high-risk localised disease. The standard of care was changed for patients with upfront metastatic disease with combined androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel becoming the new standard for fit patients with multiple bony metastases. In castrate-resistant disease, AR-V7 variants were shown to be predictive factors for resistance to next-generation AR axis-targeting agents and DNA repair targeting emerged as a promising new strategy. In poor-prognosis advanced non-seminoma, a better outcome was randomly demonstrated for the first time when a switch-intensified treatment was used in patients with a slow tumour marker decline. In metastatic kidney cancer, both cabozantinib and checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab) are now associated with improved outcomes in pretreated patients and should soon change the standard of care for these patients. Last but not least, in urothelial bladder cancer, molecular classification is evolving and suggesting that immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is active, as demonstrated in early trials.PMID: 27568660Title: Common Polymorphisms in GSTA1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 Are Associated with Susceptibility to Urinary Bladder Cancer in Individuals from Balkan Endemic Nephropathy Areas of Serbia.Authors: Matic M, Dragicevic B, Pekmezovic T, Suvakov S, Savic-Radojevic A, Pljesa-Ercegovac M, Dragicevic D, Smiljic J, Simic TSource: Tohoku J Exp Med. 2016;240(1):25-30. doi: 10.1620/tjem.240.25.Abstract: Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic familial form of interstitial nephritis that might eventually lead to end stage renal disease. This nephropathy affects individuals living along of the Danube River and its tributaries in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. The increased incidence of urinary tract tumors in the BEN areas is well described, but its specific genetic predisposition is still unclear. Certain nephrocarcinogenic compounds, including those associated with BEN, are metabolized by glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily of phase II detoxication enzymes. Importantly, the GST-mediated detoxification may result in formation of more toxic compounds. We examined the association of common GST polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BC) risk in individuals from BEN areas in Serbia. A hospital-based case-control study included 201 BC cases (67 from BEN region) and 122 controls. Each polymorphism was identified by a PCR-based method. Individuals from BEN region with low-expression GSTA1 genotype (AB+BB) exhibited a 2.6-fold higher BC risk compared to those with GSTA1 (AA) genotype who were from non-BEN region (OR = 2.60, p = 0.015). In contrast, carriers of GSTM1-active genotype from BEN region had a 2.9-fold increased BC risk compared to those with GSTM1-active genotype from non-BEN region (OR = 2.90, p = 0.010). Likewise, carriers with GSTT1-active genotype from BEN region exhibited 2.1-fold higher BC risk compared to those from non-BEN region with GSTT1-active genotype (OR = 2.10, p = 0.027). Thus, common polymorphisms in GSTA1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 are associated with susceptibility to BC in individuals from BEN areas of Serbia.PMID: 27568654Title: EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer. Part 1: Screening, Diagnosis, and Local Treatment with Curative Intent.Authors: Mottet N, Bellmunt J, Bolla M, Briers E, Cumberbatch MG, De Santis M, Fossati N, Gross T, Henry AM, Joniau S, Lam TB, Mason MD, Matveev VB, Moldovan PC, van den Bergh RC, Van den Broeck T, van der Poel HG, van der Kwast TH, Rouviere O, Schoots IG, Wiegel T, Cornford PSource: Eur Urol. 2016 Aug 25. pii: S0302-2838(16)30470-5. doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2016.08.003.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent of clinically localised prostate cancer (PCa). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013-2015). The guidelines were updated and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the evidence. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: BRCA2 mutations have been added as risk factors for early and aggressive disease. In addition to the Gleason score, the five-tier 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology grading system should now be provided. Systematic screening is still not recommended. Instead, an individual risk-adapted strategy following a detailed discussion and taking into account the patient's wishes and life expectancy must be considered. An early prostate-specific antigen test, the use of a risk calculator, or one of the promising biomarker tools are being investigated and might be able to limit the overdetection of insignificant PCa. Breaking the link between diagnosis and treatment may lower the overtreatment risk. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging using standardised reporting cannot replace systematic biopsy, but robustly nested within the diagnostic work-up, it has a key role in local staging. Active surveillance always needs to be discussed with very low-risk patients. The place of surgery in high-risk disease and the role of lymph node dissection have been clarified, as well as the management of node-positive patients. Radiation therapy using dose-escalated intensity-modulated technology is a key treatment modality with recent improvement in the outcome based on increased doses as well as combination with hormonal treatment. Moderate hypofractionation is safe and effective, but longer-term data are still lacking. Brachytherapy represents an effective way to increase the delivered dose. Focal therapy remains experimental while cryosurgery and HIFU are still lacking long-term convincing results. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge in the field of diagnosis, staging, and treatment of localised PCa is evolving rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO- SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for the use in clinical practice. These are the first PCa guidelines endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office and online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/). PATIENT SUMMARY: The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Prostate Cancer (PCa) Guidelines present updated information on the diagnosis, and treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer. In Northern and Western Europe, the number of men diagnosed with PCa has been on the rise. This may be due to an increase in opportunistic screening, but other factors may also be involved (eg, diet, sexual behaviour, low exposure to ultraviolet radiation). We propose that men who are potential candidates for screening should be engaged in a discussion with their clinician (also involving their families and caregivers) so that an informed decision may be made as part of an individualised risk-adapted approach.PMID: 27566035Title: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quality of life outcomes after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.Authors: Yang LS, Shan BL, Shan LL, Chin P, Murray S, Ahmadi N, Saxena ASource: Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep;25(3):281-97. doi: 10.1016/j.suronc.2016.05.027. Epub 2016 Jun 7.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the treatment of choice for invasive bladder cancer. Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome of surgery. This review compares the QOL after continent and incontinent urinary diversion in radical cystectomy for patients with primary invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies published after January 2000 was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Quality appraisal and data tabulation were performed using pre-determined forms. Data were synthesised by narrative review and random-effects meta-analysis using standardized response means. Heterogeneity and bias was assessed by Tau(2) and I(2) values and Funnel plots. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (3754 patients) were included for review. Pooled post-operative FACT and SF-36 scores showed no difference in overall QOL between continent and incontinent diversion (p = 0.31). Subgroup analysis demonstrated greater improvement in physical health for incontinent (p = 0.002) compared to continent diversions, but no differences in mental health (p = 0.35) and social health (p = 0.81). Qualitative analysis showed patients with neobladder had superior emotional function and body image compared to cutaneous diversion. QOL may improve to similar or better levels compared to baseline after 1 year, but data remains scarce. Patients report poor urinary and sexual function after surgery compared the general population. Long-term QOL is unclear. Levels of heterogeneity and bias were low. CONCLUSIONS: QOL after radical cystectomy is comparable after either continent or incontinent urinary diversion. Post-operative QOL may improve, but urinary and sexual dysfunction remains inferior to the general population. Patient choice is key to selection of reconstruction method.PMID: 27565154Title: Recurrent bladder carcinoma: clinical and prognostic role of 18 F-FDG PET/CT.Authors: Alongi P, Caobelli F, Gentile R, Stefano A, Russo G, Albano D, Baldari S, Gilardi MC, Midiri MSource: Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2016 Aug 26.Abstract: AIM: A small number of studies evaluated the detection rate of lesions from bladder carcinoma (BC) of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the restaging process. However, the prognostic role of FDG PET/CT still remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy, the effect upon treatment decision, and the prognostic value of FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrent BC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients affected by BC underwent FDG PET/CT for restaging purpose. The diagnostic accuracy of visually interpreted FDG PET/CT was assessed compared to histology (n = 8), other diagnostic imaging modalities (contrast-enhanced CT in 38/41 patients and MRI in 15/41) and clinical follow-up (n = 41). Semiquantitative PET values (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUL, MTV, TLG) were calculated using a graph-based method. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier curves. The risk of progression (hazard ratio, HR) was computed by Cox regression analysis by considering all the available variables. RESULTS: PET was considered positive in 21 of 41 patients. Of these, recurrent BC was confirmed in 20 (95 %). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of FDG PET/CT were 87 %, 94 %, 95 %, 85 %, 90 %. AUC was 0.9 (95 %IC 0.8-1). Bayesian positive and negative likelihood ratios were 14.5 and 0.13, respectively. FDG PET/CT findings modified the therapeutic approach in 16 patients (modified therapy in 10 PET-positive patients, watch-and-wait in six PET-negative patients). PFS was significantly longer in patients with negative scan vs. those with pathological findings (85 % vs. 24 %, p < 0.05; HR = 12.4; p = 0.001). Moreover, an unremarkable study was associated with a longer OS (88 % vs. 47 % after 2 years and 87 % vs. 25 % after 3 years, respectively, p < 0.05). Standardized uptake value (SUV)max > 6 and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) > 8.5 were recognized as the most accurate thresholds to predict PFS (2-year PFS 62 % for SUVmax < 6 vs. 15 % for SUVmax > 6, p = 0.018; 2-year PFS 66 % for TLG < 8.5 vs. 18 % for TLG > 8.5, p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: A very good diagnostic performance for FDG PET/CT was confirmed in patients with suspected recurrent BC. FDG PET/CT allowed for a change in treatment decision in about 40 % of cases and showed an important prognostic value in assessing PFS and OS.PMID: 27564296Title: A modified method by differential adhesion for enrichment of bladder cancer stem cells.Authors: Zhu YT, Pang SY, Luo Y, Chen W, Bao JM, Tan WLSource: Int Braz J Urol. 2016 Jul-Aug;42(4):817-24. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2015.0409.Abstract: PURPOSE: In a previous study the vaccine was effective against bladder cancer in a mouse model. However, a small portion of tumors regrew because the vaccine could not eliminate bladder cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we showed a modified method for the isolation of bladder CSCs using a combination of differential adhesion method and serum-free culture medium (SFM) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trypsin-resistant cells and trypsin-sensitive cells were isolated from MB49, EJ and 5637 cells by a combination of differential adhesion method and SFM method. The CSCs characterizations of trypsin-resistant cells were verified by the flow cytometry, the western blotting, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the resistance to chemotherapy assay, the transwell assay, and the tumor xenograft formation assay. RESULTS: Trypsin-resistant cells were isolated and identified in CSCs characters, with high expression of CSCs markers, higher resistance to chemotherapy, greater migration in vitro, and stronger tumorigenicity in vivo. CONCLUSION: Trypsin-resistant cells displayed specific CSCs properties. Our study showed trypsin-resistant cells were isolated successfully with a modified method using a combination of differential adhesion method and SFM method.PMID: 27564278Title: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a biomarker in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: a single-institutional longitudinal study.Authors: Favilla V, Castelli T, Urzi D, Reale G, Privitera S, Salici A, Russo GI, Cimino S, Morgia GSource: Int Braz J Urol. 2016 Jul-Aug;42(4):685-93. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2015.0243.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer represents one of the most important clinical challenges in urologic practice. In this context, inflammation has an important role in the development and progression of many malignancies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of pre-treatment Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on the risk of recurrence and progression in patients with primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained from 178 bladder cancer patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURB) between July 2008 and December 2014 were evaluated prospectively. NLR was obtained from each patient before TURB and defined as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count. Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to calculate disease recurrence and progression including NLR. RESULTS: During the follow-up study (median: 53 months), 14 (23.3%) and 44 (37.9%) (p=0.04) patients respectively with NLR<3 and >/=3experienced recurrence and 2 (3.3%) and 14 (11.9%) experienced progression (p=0.06), respectively. At the multivariate Cox regression analysis, NLR >/=3 was associated with worse disease recurrence (HR: 2.84; p<0.01). No association was found regarding disease progression. The 5-year recurrence free survival was 49% and 62% in patients with NLR>/=3 and <3 (p<0.01). The 5-year progression free survival was 77% and 93% in patients with NLR>/=3 and <3 (p=0.69). CONCLUSION: NLR predicts disease recurrence but not disease progression in NMIBC patients. NLR alterations may depend of tumor inflammatory microenvironment.PMID: 27564275Title: A comparison of preliminary oncologic outcome and postoperative complications between patients undergoing either open or robotic radical cystectomy.Authors: Cusano A, Haddock P Jr, Jackson M, Staff I, Wagner J, Meraney ASource: Int Braz J Urol. 2016 Jul-Aug;42(4):663-70. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2015.0393.Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare complications and outcomes in patients undergoing either open radical cystectomy (ORC) or robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients that underwent ORC or RRC between 2003- 2013. We statistically compared preliminary oncologic outcomes of patients for each surgical modality. RESULTS: 92 (43.2%) and 121 (56.8%) patients underwent ORC and RRC, respectively. While operative time was shorter for ORC patients (403 vs. 508 min; p<0.001), surgical blood loss and transfusion rates were significantly lower in RRC patients (p<0.001 and 0.006). Length of stay was not different between groups (p=0.221). There was no difference in the proportion of lymph node-positive patients between groups. However, RRC patients had a greater number of lymph nodes removed during surgery (18 vs. 11.5; p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of pre-existing comorbidities or in the Clavien distribution of complications between groups. ORC and RRC patients were followed for a median of 1.38 (0.55-2.7) and 1.40 (0.58-2.59) years, respectively (p=0.850). During this period, a lower proportion (22.3%) of RRC patients experienced disease recurrence vs. ORC patients (34.8%). However, there was no significant difference in time to recurrence between groups. While ORC was associated with a higher all-cause mortality rate (p=0.049), there was no significant difference in disease-free survival time between groups. CONCLUSIONS: ORC and RRC patients experience postoperative complications of similar rates and severity. However, RRC may offer indirect benefits via reduced surgical blood loss and need for transfusion.PMID: 27564274Title: Extraperitoneal versus transperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy for selected elderly bladder cancer patients: a single center experience.Authors: Feng L, Song J, Wu M, Tian Y, Zhang DSource: Int Braz J Urol. 2016 Jul-Aug;42(4):655-62. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2015.0608.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study reports the initial experience of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (ELRC) and compared with transperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (TLRC) in the treatment of selected elderly bladder cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of forty male bladder cancer patients who underwent ELRC (n=19) or TLRC (n=21) with ureterocutaneostomy were investigated. Demographic parameters, perioperative variables, oncological outcomes and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A significantly shorter time to exsufflation (1.5+/-0.7 vs 2.1+/-1.1 d; p=0.026) and liquid intake (1.8+/-0.9 vs 2.8+/-1.9 d; p=0.035) were observed in the ELRC group compared with the TLRC group. The incidence of postoperative ileus in the ELRC group was lower than the TLRC group (0 vs 9.5%). However, the difference had no statistical significance (p>0.05). The removed lymph node number in the ELRC group was significantly lower than the TLRC group (p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the overall and cancer-free survival rates (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ELRC seems to be a safe and feasible surgical strategy for the selected elderly bladder cancer patients with </=T2 disease. The surgical and oncological efficacy of the ELRC is similar to that of the TLRC, but with faster intestinal function recovery. Further studies with a large series including different urinary diversions are needed to confirm our results and to better evaluate the benefit of ELRC in bladder cancer patients.PMID: 27564266Title: Roles of SPARC in urothelial carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis.Authors: Said NSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11590.Abstract: Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular glycoprotein that is implicated in myriad physiological and pathological conditions characterized by extensive remodeling and plasticity. The functions and disease association of SPARC in cancer is being increasingly appreciated as it plays multi-faceted contextual roles depending on the cancer type, cell of origin and the unique cancer milieu at both primary and metastatic sites. Herein we will review our current knowledge of the role of SPARC in the multistep cascades of urinary bladder carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis from preclinical models and clinical data and shine the light on its prognostic and therapeutic potentials.PMID: 27564099Title: Curcumin potentiates antitumor activity of cisplatin in bladder cancer cell lines via ROS-mediated activation of ERK1/2.Authors: Park BH, Lim JE, Jeon HG, Seo SI, Lee HM, Choi HY, Jeon SS, Jeong BCSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11563.Abstract: Resistance of bladder cancer to cisplatin is a major obstacle to successful treatment. In the current study, we investigated the apoptotic effects of curcumin and cisplatin co-treatment in 253J-Bv(p53 wild-type) and T24(p53 mutant) bladder cancer. We found that curcumin and cisplatin co-treatment primarily targets reactive oxygen species(ROS) and extracellular regulated kinase(ERK) signaling during the apoptosis induction in bladder cancer. The apoptosis rate in 253J-Bv and T24 cells co-treated with curcumin and cisplatin was increased compared to that in cells exposed to single-agent treatment conditions. Also, caspase-3 activation and ROS production were observed in both cells treated with curcumin and cisplatin, together with upregulation of p-MEK and p-ERK1/2 signaling. NAC(ROS scavenger) and U0126(ERK inhibitor) inhibited apoptosis induced by curcumin and cisplatin. In addition, when 253J-Bv cells were co-treated with curcumin and cisplatin, p53 and p21 expression levels were markedly increased when compared to controls. Unlike 253J-Bv cells, T24 cells were co-treated with curcumin and cisplatin revealed an induction of apoptosis through decreased p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3) expression. Moreover, pretreatment with U0126 suppressed curcumin and cisplatin-induced upregulation of p53, p21, and p-STAT3 and downregulation of survival proteins in both cells. In conclusion, co-treatment with curcumin and cisplatin synergistically induced apoptosis through ROS-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in bladder cancer.PMID: 27563657Title: Immunobiology and immunotherapy in genitourinary malignancies.Authors: Tsiatas M, Grivas PSource: Ann Transl Med. 2016 Jul;4(14):270. doi: 10.21037/atm.2016.06.29.Abstract: Immunotherapy has traditionally been a critical component of the cancer treatment armamentarium in genitourinary (GU) cancers. It has an established role in the management of carefully selected patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [e.g., high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) [e.g., intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)]. In 2010, the sipuleucel-T vaccine was approved by the FDA for the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), based on a phase III trial showing overall survival (OS) benefit compared to placebo. The immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (anti-PD-1) recently received FDA approval for the management of patients with advanced RCC patients previously treated with anti-angiogenic therapy, based on OS benefit compared to everolimus. Recently, large clinical trials demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit, including durable responses, as well as a good tolerability/safety profile with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced RCC and chemotherapy-resistant advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC), while FDA just approved atezolizumab for platinum-treated advanced UC. Numerous interesting trials in different cancers are ongoing. Several combinations of immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapeutics, vaccines, targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors & monoclonal antibodies, epigenetic modifiers, anti-angiogenic agents, tumor microenvironment & myeloid cell targeting therapies, metabolic modification strategies, radiation, and others, are being tested in clinical trials. Comprehensive understanding of the factors underlying antitumor immune responses in physiologically relevant animal models and humans will refine further the clinical benefit of immunotherapy. Discovery and validation of appropriate molecular biomarkers via coordinated translational research efforts, rational clinical trial designs with suitable endpoints and well-defined eligibility criteria, prospective registries/databases, careful evaluation of cost-effectiveness and safety/tolerability, adequate funding and open continuous discussions among all stakeholders will support the revolutionary nature of immunotherapy in GU cancers.PMID: 27563651Title: DNA damage, tumor mutational load and their impact on immune responses against cancer.Authors: Liontos M, Anastasiou I, Bamias A, Dimopoulos MASource: Ann Transl Med. 2016 Jul;4(14):264. doi: 10.21037/atm.2016.07.11.Abstract: Advances in immunotherapy have changed the therapeutic landscape in many malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have already received regulatory approval in melanomas, lung, renal and bladder carcinomas. A common feature of these neoplasms is the increased mutational load, related to a possible increase number of tumor neoantigens that are recognized by the immune system. The mechanisms that DNA damage could confer to the mutational load and the formation of neoantigens and how this could be exploited to advance our immunotherapeutic strategies is discussed in this review.PMID: 27563483Title: Clinical Behavior of Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma in Young Patients: A Single Center Experience.Authors: Sen V, Bozkurt O, Demir O, Esen AA, Mungan U, Aslan G, Kefi A, Celebi ISource: Scientifica (Cairo). 2016;2016:6792484. doi: 10.1155/2016/6792484. Epub 2016 Aug 2.Abstract: Background. There is not enough evidence about clinical behavior of bladder cancer in younger patients. Objective. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of bladder urothelial carcinoma patients under the age of 40 years. Methods. Medical records of patients listed in our cancer database were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 40 patients who were initially diagnosed with bladder urothelial carcinoma at the age less than 40 years were included in the study. Patients' records were reviewed for recurrence and progression rates, demographic data, medical history, and treatment modalities. Results. Pathological results revealed 33 (82.5%) Ta low-grade, 6 (15%) T1 high-grade, and 1 (2.5%) T2 high-grade urothelial carcinomas. Recurrence was detected in 14/39 (35.9%) patients but progression was not observed in any patients. The mean age of recurrent patients was significantly higher than nonrecurrent patients (34.8 versus 28.5 years; p < 0.05). Besides, recurrence was detected in only 1 patient with the age under 30 years (6.2%) and 13 patients (54.1%) between 30 and 40 years old, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Bladder urothelial carcinoma diagnosed at young age tends to be a low pathologic stage, with relatively low rate of recurrence and progression.PMID: 27563352Title: Bladder preservation in non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): a single-institution experience.Authors: Gerardi MA, Jereczek-Fossa BA, Zerini D, Surgo A, Dicuonzo S, Spoto R, Fodor C, Verri E, Rocca MC, Nole F, Muto M, Ferro M, Musi G, Bottero D, Matei DV, De Cobelli O, Orecchia RSource: Ecancermedicalscience. 2016 Jul 14;10:657. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2016.657. eCollection 2016.Abstract: The aim of this study is to access the feasibility, toxicity profile, and tumour outcome of an organ preservation curative approach in non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients affected by M0 bladder cancer, who refused cystectomy and were treated with a curative approach. The standard bladder preservation scheme included maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and combination of radiotherapy and platin-based chemotherapy, followed by endoscopic evaluation, urine cytology, and instrumental evaluation. Thirteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. TNM stage was cT2cN0M0 and cT2cNxM0, in 12 and one patients, respectively. All patients had transitional cell cancer. Twelve patients completed the whole therapeutic programme (a bimodal treatment without chemotherapy for one patient). Median follow-up is 36 months. None of the patients developed severe urinary or intestinal acute toxicity. In 10 patients with a follow-up > 6 months, no cases of severe late toxicity were observed. Response evaluated in 12 patients included complete response and stable disease in 11 patients (92%), and one patient (8%), respectively. At the time of data analysis (March 2016), 10 patients (77%) are alive with no evidence of disease, two patients (15%) died for other reasons, and one patient has suspicious persistent local disease. The trimodality approach, including maximal TURBT, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, is well-tolerated and might be considered a valid and feasible option in fit patients who refuse radical cystectomy.PMID: 27563235Title: Design and characteristics of cytotoxic fibroblast growth factor 1 conjugate for fibroblast growth factor receptor-targeted cancer therapy.Authors: Szlachcic A, Zakrzewska M, Lobocki M, Jakimowicz P, Otlewski JSource: Drug Des Devel Ther. 2016 Aug 9;10:2547-60. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S105896. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are attractive candidate cancer therapy targets as they are overexpressed in multiple types of tumors, such as breast, prostate, bladder, and lung cancer. In this study, a natural ligand of FGFR, an engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1V), was conjugated to a potent cytotoxic drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and used as a targeting agent for cancer cells overexpressing FGFRs, similar to antibodies in antibody-drug conjugates. The FGF1V-valine-citrulline-MMAE conjugate showed a favorable stability profile, bound FGFRs on the cell surface specifically, and efficiently released the drug (MMAE) upon cleavage by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Importantly, the conjugate showed a prominent cytotoxic effect toward cell lines expressing FGFR. FGF1V-vcMMAE was highly cytotoxic at concentrations even an order of magnitude lower than those found for free MMAE. This effect was FGFR-specific as cells lacking FGFR did not show any increased mortality.PMID: 27562722Title: Long non-coding RNA UCA1 promotes the tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Chen P, Wan D, Zheng D, Zheng Q, Wu F, Zhi QSource: Biomed Pharmacother. 2016 Aug 22;83:1220-1226. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2016.08.041.Abstract: The contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains largely unknown. Urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1), which is an originally identified lncRNA in bladder cancer, has be proved to play a pivotal role in bladder cancer progression and embryonic development. In this study, we detected the mRNA expression of UCA1 in 128 PC patients by qRT-PCR, and found that UCA1 expression was significantly, up-regulated in tumor tissues than that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.05). Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that UCA1 expression in PC significantly correlated with malignant potential factors such as tumor size (p=0.021), depth of invasion (p=0.033), CA19-9 level (p=0.034) and tumor stage (p=0.013). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis also confirmed that high UCA1 expression was an independent prognostic biomarker of PC (p=0.046), which led to an obviously shorter 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to those patients with low UCA1 expressions (p=0.018). Furthermore, we effectively down-regulated UCA1 mRNA expression by transfecting RNA interfere fragments into SW-1990 cells, and our results in vitro indicated that down-regulation of UCA1 could effectively inhibit the cell proliferative activities, induce apoptotic rate and cause cell cycle arrest in PC cells (p<0.05). Meanwhile, UCA1 expression negative-correlated with p27 in PC tissues (r2=0.46, p<0.01), and knockdown of p27 partly abrogated the cell proliferative activities caused by UCA1 (p<0.05). Our results raised the possibility of using UCA1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapy target of PC, and down-regulation of UCA1 might be considered to be a novel molecular treatment strategy for patients with PC.PMID: 27562672Title: Risk of cancer in Asian Americans: a Kaiser Permanente cohort study.Authors: Tran HN, Li Y, Udaltsova N, Armstrong MA, Friedman GD, Klatsky ALSource: Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Oct;27(10):1197-207. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0798-2. Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: PURPOSE: To supplement published cohort data about incident cancer in Asian Americans (Asians) including risk of specific Asian ethnic groups. METHODS: A cohort study in 124,193 persons (13,344 Asians) with baseline examination data in 1978-1985 used Cox proportional hazards models with seven covariates to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Through 2012 cancer was diagnosed in 18,687 persons including 1,522 Asians. Compared to Whites, the HR (CIs) for any cancer in Asians was 0.8 (0.7-0.9, p < 0.001). Lower Asian risk was stronger for men (HR = 0.7, p < 0.001) than for women (HR = 0.9, p = 0.003). Lower Asian vs. White risks with p < 0.05 were found for cancers of the upper airway digestive area, hematologic malignancies, melanoma, and cancers of the prostate, bladder, and brain. Melanoma contributed substantially to lower Asian risk, especially in women. HRs for specific Asian groups versus Whites follow: Chinese = 0.9 (p < 0.001), Japanese = 0.9 (p = 0.01), Filipinos = 0.8 (p < 0.001), South Asians = 0.5 (p < 0.001), and Other Asians = 0.7 (p = 0.006). Both South Asian men and women had lower risk than Whites, and South Asians had lower risk than any other racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Asians had lower cancer risk than Whites, due to lower risk of several cancer types. Each Asian ethnic group had lower risk than Whites with South Asians at the lowest risk.
