PMID: 27652111Title: Prognostic role of microRNA-203 in various carcinomas: evidence from a meta-analysis involving 13 studies.Authors: Liang Y, Yang W, Zhu Y, Yuan YSource: Springerplus. 2016 Sep 13;5(1):1538. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Growing evidence from recent studies has revealed that microRNA-203 (miR-203) might be an attractive prognostic biomarker for cancer. But controversy still remains. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize available evidences and clarify the preliminary predictive value of miR-203 for prognosis in cancer patients. Eligible studies were identified through multiple research strategies in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science up to October 2015. Key statistics such as pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to calculate patient survival. 13 eligible studies with 1600 patients were ultimately enrolled in this meta-analysis. Our results failed to show a significant relation between upregulated miR-203 expression and a favorable overall survival (OS) (HR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.65-1.36) in a random effect model. However, in subgroup analysis, we found that high expression of miR-203 was significantly associated with poor OS in Caucasian patients (HR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.06-1.55). In contrast, for Asian patients, over-expression of miR-203 was an independent prognostic factor for better and OS (HR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.22-0.96). It also suggested that cancer types and miRNA assay method were significant associated with prognosis. The over-expression of miR-203 was effectively predictive of worse prognosis in breast cancer (HR 6.35, 95 % CI 1.34-11.36), pancreatic cancer (HR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.08-1.30), ependymoma (HR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.10-1.61), but for glioma patients, elevated miR-203 is a potential biomarker for predicting better progression of cancer (HR 0.26, 95 % CI -0.02 to 0.54). Besides, for direct miRNA profiling studies, over-expression of miR-203 was an independent prognostic factor for worse OS (HR 6.35, 95 % CI 1.34-11.36). This meta-analysis indicated that ethnicity, tumor type and miRNA assay method mainly contributed to heterogeneity. Considering the insufficient evidence, further relevant studies are warranted.PMID: 27651335Title: Management of the splenic vein during a pancreaticoduodenectomy with venous resection for malignancy.Authors: Addeo P, Nappo G, Felli E, Oncioiu C, Faitot F, Bachellier PSource: Updates Surg. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: Nowadays, pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD) with an "en-bloc" resection of the spleno-mesenterico-portal (SMP) venous axis are safely performed at tertiary centers for patients presenting venous invasion. However, for tumors infiltrating the SMP confluence optimal management of the splenic vein (SV) remains a matter of debate. Simple SV ligation has been associated with the development of sinistral portal hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypersplenism over the long term. To avoid these complications, reconstructive methods such as the direct implantation of the SV into a SMP "neoconfluence", the inferior mesenteric vein-SV anastomosis and the distal spleno-renal shunt have been reported. This article summarizes the different technical solutions available and the current evidence supporting the optimal management of the SV stump during a "safe" radical PD for pancreatic cancer. Technical issues, advantages as well as drawbacks of the different techniques, are discussed.PMID: 27650825Title: Prognostic Value of the CRP/Alb Ratio, a Novel Inflammation-Based Score in Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Liu Z, Jin K, Guo M, Long J, Liu L, Liu C, Xu J, Ni Q, Luo G, Yu XSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio is associated with outcome in septic patients. However, as an inflammation-based score, its prognostic value for cancer has scarcely been investigated. METHODS: Between February 2010 and January 2015, we enrolled 386 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis between the groups were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristics curves were generated and areas under the curve (AUC) were compared to evaluate the discriminatory ability of the inflammation-based prognostic scoring systems, including CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS). RESULTS: The optimal cutoff level of the CRP/Alb ratio was defined as 0.180. The prognosis of patients with CRP/Alb ratio >/=0.180 was significantly worse than CRP/Alb ratio <0.180 in univariate analysis (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the CRP/Alb ratio was still associated with overall survival (p < 0.001). In addition, the CRP/Alb ratio had significantly higher AUC values compared with PLR (6, 12, and 24 months: p < 0.001, 0.017, 0.012) and mGPS (6, 12, and 24 months: p = 0.002, 0.020, 0.046) and had similar AUC values to NLR (6, 12, and 24 months: p = 0.052, 0.139, 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated the CRP/Alb ratio may serve as a significant and promising inflammatory prognostic score in pancreatic cancer. An elevated CRP/Alb ratio is an independent factor for poor prognosis with the cutoff value of 0.180.PMID: 27649892Title: Energy sources identify metabolic phenotypes in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Liang C, Qin Y, Zhang B, Ji S, Shi S, Xu W, Liu J, Xiang J, Liang D, Hu Q, Liu L, Liu C, Luo G, Ni Q, Xu J, Yu XSource: Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming is one of the emerging hallmarks of cancers. As a highly malignant tumor, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is not only a metabolic disease but also a heterogeneous disease. Heterogeneity induces PDA dependence on distinct nutritive substrates, thereby inducing different metabolic phenotypes. We stratified PDA into four phenotypes with distinct types of energy metabolism, including a Warburg phenotype, a reverse Warburg phenotype, a glutaminolysis phenotype, and a lipid-dependent phenotype. The four phenotypes possess distinct metabolic features and reprogram their metabolic pathways to adapt to stress. The metabolic type present in PDA should prompt differential imaging and serologic metabolite detection for diagnosis and prognosis. The targeting of an individual metabolic phenotype with corresponding metabolic inhibitors is considered a promising therapeutic approach and, in combination with chemotherapy, is expected to be a novel strategy for PDA treatment.PMID: 27649783Title: The PRKD1 promoter is a target of the KRas-NF-kappaB pathway in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Doppler H, Panayiotou R, Reid EM, Maimo W, Bastea L, Storz PSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 21;6:33758. doi: 10.1038/srep33758.Abstract: Increased expression of PRKD1 and its gene product protein kinase D1 (PKD1) are linked to oncogenic signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, but a direct functional relationship to oncogenic KRas has not been established so far. We here describe the PRKD1 gene promoter as a target for oncogenic KRas signaling. We demonstrate that KRas-induced activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway is one mechanism of how PRKD1 expression is increased and identify the binding sites for NF-kappaB in the PRKD1 promoter. Altogether, these results describe a novel mechanism governing PRKD1 gene expression in PDA and provide a functional link between oncogenic KRas, NF-kappaB and expression of PRKD1.PMID: 27649287Title: Ephrin-B2 overexpression predicts for poor prognosis and response to therapy in solid tumors.Authors: Oweida A, Bhatia S, Hirsch K, Calame D, Griego A, Keysar S, Pitts T, Sharma J, Eckhardt G, Jimeno A, Wang XJ, Parkash G, Califano J, Karam SSource: Mol Carcinog. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/mc.22574.Abstract: Ephrin B2 is variably expressed on tumor cells and its blockade has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in animal models of pancreatic, colorectal, lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. However, the implications of ephrinB2 expression in cancer patients have remained elusive. In this study, we analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) for ephrinB2 expression. We report significant correlations between EFNB2 expression, overall survival and disease-free survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC, n = 519), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 186) and bladder urothelial carcinoma (n = 410). In HNSCC patients, high EFNB2 mRNA expression was associated with tumor HPV negativity, oral cavity location, alcohol intake, higher TP53 mutation, and EGFR amplification. EphrinB2 overexpression also correlated with worse response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The therapeutic potential of blocking ephrinB2 was validated in HNSCC patient-derived tumor xenografts and showed significant improvement in survival and tumor growth delay. Our data shows that ephrinB2 overexpression can serve as a critical biomarker for patient prognosis and response to therapy. These results should guide design of future clinical trials exploring EphrinB2 inhibition in cancer patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Given the noncurative nature of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, treatment is aimed at inducing disease regression, controlling symptom, and extending life. The last 5 years have been marked by advances in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, specifically the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of 2 combination chemotherapy regimens and the widespread use of a third, which have reproducibly been shown to improve survival. Ongoing studies are building on these regimens along with targeted and immunotherapeutic agents. This article will review the current treatment standards and emerging targets for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Cancer 2016.

Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: Background. There is a high incidence of inconclusive cytopathology at initial EUS-FNA (endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration) for suspected malignant pancreatic lesions. To obtain appropriate preoperative or palliative chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, definitive cytopathology is often required. The utility of repeat EUS-FNA is not well established. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted evaluating the yield of repeat EUS-FNA in determining a cytological diagnosis in patients who had undergone a prior EUS-FNA for diagnosis of suspected malignant pancreatic lesions with inconclusive cytopathology. The wait times to the second procedure and to decisions regarding therapy were calculated. Results. Overall, 45 repeat EUS-FNA procedures were performed over seven years for suspected malignant pancreatic lesions. Cytopathological class (I to IV) changed between first and second EUS-FNA in 32 patients (71%). Of 34 patients with an initially nonconclusive diagnosis, 20 had a conclusive diagnosis (59%) on repeat EUS-FNA. The cumulative yield after repeat EUS-FNA for definite pancreatic adenocarcinoma was 7 (16%). The median time interval between first and second EUS-FNA was 31 (7-175) days. Conclusions. A substantial number of patients had a definitive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma on repeat FNA and were, therefore, subsequently able to access appropriate care.PMID: 27648370Title: DNA integrity as biomarker in pancreatic cyst fluid.Authors: Utomo WK, Janmaat VT, Verhaar AP, Cros J, Levy P, Ruszniewski P, den Berg MS, Jenster G, Bruno MJ, Braat H, Fuhler GM, Peppelenbosch MPSource: Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 1;6(8):1837-41. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Identification of pancreatic cysts with malignant potential is important to prevent pancreatic cancer development. Integrity of cell free DNA (cfDNA) has been described as tumor biomarker, but its potential for pancreatic cancer is unclear. While normal apoptotic cells release uniformly truncated DNA, malignant tissues release long fragments of cell free DNA (cfDNA). We measured 247 base pair (bp) and 115 bp DNA fragments of ALU repeats by qPCR in serum from healthy controls and pancreatic cancer patients, and in cyst fluid from pancreatic cyst patients. No differences in total cfDNA (ALU115) and cfDNA integrity (ALU247/115) were observed between sera from healthy controls (n=19) and pancreatic cancer patients (n=19). Although elevated as compared to serum, but no differences in cfDNA were found in cyst fluid from high risk (n=10) and low risk (n=20) cyst patients. We conclude that cfDNA integrity is not a useful marker to identify (pre)malignant pancreatic lesions.PMID: 27648368Title: Elevated expression of CTHRC1 predicts unfavorable prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Authors: Liu W, Fu XL, Yang JY, Yang MW, Tao LY, Liu DJ, Huo YM, Zhang JF, Hua R, Sun YWSource: Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 1;6(8):1820-7. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1), a secreted protein, has been demonstrated as an oncogene in many types of human cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, little is known about the prognostic value of CTHRC1 in PDAC. In current study, we investigated the expression pattern and underlying clinical significance of CTHRC1 in PDAC. Data from public PDAC microarray datasets, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CTHRC1 expression was dramatically increased in PDAC compared with normal tissues at both mRNA and protein level, which was consistent with previous studies. Analysis of its correlation with clinicopathological parameters indicated that high protein expression level of CTHRC1 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and perineural invasion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with higher CTHRC1 expression exhibited a remarkably shorter overall survival in four different PDAC patient cohorts. Importantly, univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that CTHRC1 protein expression level was a significant and independent prognostic factor for overall survival rate of PDAC patients. Together, these data suggested that CTHRC1 is an unfavorable biomarker of prognosis in PDAC and may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for PDAC treatment.PMID: 27647971Title: Radical nerve dissection for the carcinoma of head of pancreas: report of 30 cases.Authors: Lin Q, Tan L, Zhou Y, Zhou Q, Chen RSource: Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;28(4):429-34. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.04.06.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of the radical nerve dissection (RND) for the carcinoma of head of pancreas (CHP). METHODS: The clinical and pathological data of 30 CHP patients who underwent RND in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed, with an attempt to explore the safety and short-term efficacy of this procedure. RESULTS: Among these 30 patients, the operative time was (351+/-61) min, the intra-operative blood loss was 350 (range, 300-600) mL, and the grades B and C pancreatic fistula was 23.33%. During the follow-up (range, 2-30 months; median: 17 months), the 1-year survival rate was 63.33% and the 1-year disease-free survival rate was 56.67%. Among the 23 patients (76.66%) with positive extra-pancreatic perineural invasion (PNI), the 1-year casefatality rate was 34.78%, which was not significantly different from that (28.57%) of patients with negative PNI (P=0.760). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested potential advantages of RND in the fields of surgery-associated risk and prognosis compared with the Whipple operation in the treatment of CHP. Due to the low sample size of this study, further well-designed research of large sample size is needed.PMID: 27647970Title: Total mesopancreas excision for pancreatic head cancer: analysis of 120 cases.Authors: Wu W, Wang X, Wu X, Li M, Weng H, Cao Y, Bao R, Su S, Lu J, Gong W, Shi W, Gu J, Wang X, Liu Y, Quan Z, Peng SSource: Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;28(4):423-8. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.04.05.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of total mesopancreas excision (TMpE) in the treatment of pancreatic head cancer. METHODS: The clinical and pathological data of 120 patients with pancreatic head cancer who had undergone TMpE in our center from May 2010 to January 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The mean operative time was (275.0+/-50.2) min and the average intra-operative blood loss was (390.0+/-160.5) mL. Post-operative complications were reported in 45 patients, while no peri-operative death was noted. The specimen margins were measured in three dimensions, and 86 patients (71.6%) achieved R0 resection. CONCLUSIONS: TMpE is safe and feasible for pancreatic head cancer and is particularly helpful to increase the R0 resection rate.PMID: 27647802Title: Next-generation sequencing adds value to the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cysts.Authors: Rosenbaum MW, Jones M, Dudley JC, Le LP, Iafrate AJ, Pitman MBSource: Cancer Cytopathol. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/cncy.21775.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of a pancreatic cyst as mucinous or high-risk dictates the need for follow-up or surgery. Molecular analysis of aspirated pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) can provide valuable information not obtained by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) analysis or cytology. METHODS: All patients who underwent molecular analysis of PCF between March 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed, including pathology, imaging, and follow-up. Molecular testing was performed using a patented, anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, which sequenced numerous hotspots in 39 genes linked with malignancy. Performance of NGS and cytology was calculated using final outcome, as determined by clinicopathologic follow-up. RESULTS: The study cohort included 113 PCFs from 105 patients. In total, 119 variants were detected in 67 PCFs (59%). Variants were more common in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)/cancer than in nonmucinous cysts (P < .005). The inclusion of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNAS) variants improved the classification of IPMNs as mucinous from 50% by microscopy to 100%. Seventy-five percent of cancers had high-grade atypia versus 0% of IPMNs and nonmucinous cysts (P < .002). Variants in tumor protein 53 (TP53), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), and notch1 (NOTCH1) were detected only in malignant cysts. Cytology was similarly specific (100%) for detecting malignant cysts but was more sensitive than the identification of late mutations by NGS (75% vs 46%). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of KRAS/GNAS variants improves the identification of mucinous neoplasms. Variants in TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 support the diagnosis of a high-risk cyst requiring surgery or additional sampling. Although molecular analysis is not a replacement for cytopathology, it does provide valuable information for accurate preoperative diagnosis, helping to classify mucinous neoplasms and high-risk cysts that require surgical resection.

However, there is no universally accepted system. METHODS: An analysis was performed to evaluate the application of the ENETS and AJCC staging classifications using the SEER registry (N = 2,529 patients) and a multicentric series (N = 1,143 patients). A modified system was proposed based on analysis of the two existing classifications. The modified system was then validated. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with AJCC stage III disease was extremely low for both the SEER series (2.2%) and the multicentric series (2.1%). For the ENETS staging system, patients with stage I disease had a similar prognosis to patients with stage IIA disease, and patients with stage IIIB disease had a lower hazard ratio for death than did patients with stage IIIA disease. We modified the ENETS staging classification by maintaining the ENETS T, N, and M definitions and adopting the AJCC staging definitions. The proportion of patients with stage III disease using the modified ENETS (mENETS) system was higher than that of the AJCC system in both the SEER series (8.9% v 2.2%) and the multicentric series (11.6% v 2.1%). In addition, the hazard ratio of death for patients with stage III disease was higher than that for patients with stage IIB disease. Moreover, statistical significance and proportional distribution were observed in the mENETS staging classification. CONCLUSION: An mENETS staging classification is more suitable for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors than either the AJCC or ENETS systems and can be adopted in clinical practice.PMID: 27646934Title: Dynamic landscape of pancreatic carcinogenesis reveals early molecular networks of malignancy.Authors: Kong B, Bruns P, Behler NA, Chang L, Schlitter AM, Cao J, Gewies A, Ruland J, Fritzsche S, Valkovskaya N, Jian Z, Regel I, Raulefs S, Irmler M, Beckers J, Friess H, Erkan M, Mueller NS, Roth S, Hackert T, Esposito I, Theis FJ, Kleeff J, Michalski CWSource: Gut. 2016 Sep 19. pii: gutjnl-2015-310913. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310913.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The initial steps of pancreatic regeneration versus carcinogenesis are insufficiently understood. Although a combination of oncogenic Kras and inflammation has been shown to induce malignancy, molecular networks of early carcinogenesis remain poorly defined. DESIGN: We compared early events during inflammation, regeneration and carcinogenesis on histological and transcriptional levels with a high temporal resolution using a well-established mouse model of pancreatitis and of inflammation-accelerated KrasG12D-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Quantitative expression data were analysed and extensively modelled in silico. RESULTS: We defined three distinctive phases-termed inflammation, regeneration and refinement-following induction of moderate acute pancreatitis in wild-type mice. These corresponded to different waves of proliferation of mesenchymal, progenitor-like and acinar cells. Pancreas regeneration required a coordinated transition of proliferation between progenitor-like and acinar cells. In mice harbouring an oncogenic Kras mutation and challenged with pancreatitis, there was an extended inflammatory phase and a parallel, continuous proliferation of mesenchymal, progenitor-like and acinar cells. Analysis of high-resolution transcriptional data from wild-type animals revealed that organ regeneration relied on a complex interaction of a gene network that normally governs acinar cell homeostasis, exocrine specification and intercellular signalling. In mice with oncogenic Kras, a specific carcinogenic signature was found, which was preserved in full-blown mouse pancreas cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These data define a transcriptional signature of early pancreatic carcinogenesis and a molecular network driving formation of preneoplastic lesions, which allows for more targeted biomarker development in order to detect cancer earlier in patients with pancreatitis.PMID: 27646614Title: Prognostic impact of splenic artery invasion for pancreatic cancer of the body and tail.Authors: Fukami Y, Kaneoka Y, Atsuyuki M, Takayama Y, Onoe SSource: Int J Surg. 2016 Sep 16. pii: S1743-9191(16)30924-4. doi: 10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.09.076.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of splenic artery (SA) invasion after resection for pancreatic cancer of the body and tail has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of SA invasion for pancreatic cancer of the body and tail. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2015, 64 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP) for histologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the body and tail were included in this study. Clinicopathological prognostic factors for survival were analyzed using a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: Of the 64 study patients, histologic invasion of the SA was confirmed in 23 (35.9%) cases. The prognosis of patients with SA invasion was significantly worse than that of patients with non-SA invasion (median survival: 16.0 versus 34.7 months, p=0.014). Multivariate analysis indicated that lymph node metastases (risk ratio: 2.817, p=0.005) and R1 resection (risk ratio: 2.715, p=0.006) were independently associated with overall survival after DP for pancreatic cancer of the body and tail. In contrast, SA invasion was not extracted as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: SA invasion after resection for pancreatic cancer of the body and tail does not have the prognostic impact that surpasses lymph node metastases.PMID: 27645051Title: Neuroendocrine tumors: moving from the land of small tumors to an expanding universe.Authors: Pavel MSource: Endocr Relat Cancer. 2016 Sep 19. pii: ERC-16-0371.Abstract: Extract: During my medical studies at the Georg August University of Gottingen in the late 1980's, I was truly inspired early by my mentor and University teacher Werner Creutzfeldt to begin working in the field of neuroendocrine Tumors (NET). Werner Creutzfeldt was a leader of excellence in the field of gastrointestinal endocrinology, neuroendocrine tumors and the entero-insulinar axis/incretin system in Germany. At this time, treatment of NET, i.e. pancreatic NET was reduced to the use of chemotherapeutics like streptozotocin and others with less success. One of the great discoveries of this period was the introduction of somatostatin analogs, particularly octreotide that inhibits gastroenteropancreatic secretion and tumor related secretion of bioactive compounds. Clinical trials in Germany and Sweden further explored the role of somatostatin analogs and interferon for tumor growth control. The first placebo-controlled trial (PROMID) demonstrated antiproliferative efficacy of octreotide in midgut NET. Due to the rarity of the disease, large randomized controlled trials in an international setting involving 50-70 centers from different parts of the world paved the way for evidence based medicine in distinct types of NET in the last decade and lead to approval of novel drugs. Ongoing research projects focus on molecular alterations and improving our understanding of interactions of signalling pathways in NET.PMID: 27644962Title: Factors predicting adequate lymph node yield in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for malignancy.Authors: Sierzega M, Bobrzynski L, Matyja A, Kulig JSource: World J Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 20;14(1):248. doi: 10.1186/s12957-016-1005-3.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most pancreatoduodenectomy resections do not meet the minimum of 12 lymph nodes recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer for accurate staging of periampullary malignancies. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors affecting the likelihood of adequate nodal yield in pancreatoduodenectomy specimens subject to routine pathological assessment. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-two patients subject to pancreatoduodenectomy between 1990 and 2013 for pancreatic, ampullary, and common bile duct cancers were reviewed. Predictors of yielding at least 12 lymph nodes were evaluated with a logistic regression model, and a survival analysis was carried out to verify the prognostic implications of nodal counts. RESULTS: The median number of evaluated nodes was 17 (interquartile range 11 to 25), and less than 12 lymph nodes were reported in surgical specimens of 179 (27 %) patients. Tumor diameter >/=20 mm (odds ratio [OR] 2.547, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.225 to 5.329, P = 0.013), lymph node metastases (OR 2.642, 95 % CI 1.378 to 5.061, P = 0.004), and radical lymphadenectomy (OR 5.566, 95 % CI 2.041 to 15.148, P = 0.01) were significant predictors of retrieving 12 or more lymph nodes. Lymph node counts did not influence the overall prognosis of the patients. However, a subgroup analysis carried out for individual cancer sites demonstrated that removing at least 12 lymph nodes is associated with better prognosis for pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Few variables affect adequate nodal yield in pancreatoduodenectomy specimens subject to routine pathological assessment. Considering the ambiguities related to the only modifiable factor identified, appropriate pathology training should be considered to increase nodal yield rather than more aggressive lymphatic dissection.PMID: 27644909Title: Pancreatic cancer chemoradiotherapy.Authors: Brunner TB, Seufferlein TSource: Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug;30(4):617-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bpg.2016.08.001. Epub 2016 Aug 20.Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal gastrointestinal tumour. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy in the majority of the patients whereas resection is the only chance of cure but only possible in 15-20% of all patients. The integration of radiotherapy into multimodal treatment concepts is heavily investigated. It is now commonly accepted that induction chemotherapy should precede radiotherapy. When fractionated conventionally it should be given as chemoradiotherapy. Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy emerged as an alternative, but will have to be carefully investigated in clinical trials. This review aims to give an overview of radiotherapeutic strategies with a focus on the latest developments in the field in the context of chemotherapy and surgery.PMID: 27644326Title: MIST1 and PTF1 Collaborate in Feed-forward Regulatory Loops that Maintain the Pancreatic Acinar Phenotype in Adult Mice.Authors: Jiang M, Azevedo-Pouly A, Deering TG, Hoang CQ, DiRenzo D, Hess DA, Konieczny SF, Swift GH, MacDonald RJSource: Mol Cell Biol. 2016 Sep 19. pii: MCB.00370-16.Abstract: Much remains unknown regarding the regulatory networks formed by transcription factors in mature, differentiated mammalian cells in vivo, despite many studies of individual DNA-binding transcription factors. We report a constellation of feed-forward loops formed by the pancreatic transcription factors MIST1 and PTF1 that govern the differentiated phenotype of the adult pancreatic acinar cell. PTF1 is an atypical basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor complex of pancreatic acinar cells and critical to acinar cell fate specification and differentiation. MIST1, also a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, enhances the formation and maintenance of the specialized phenotype of professional secretory cells. The MIST1 and PTF1 collaboration controls a wide range of specialized cellular processes, including secretory protein synthesis and processing, exocytosis, and homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum. PTF1 drives Mist1 transcription, and MIST1 and PTF1 bind and drive the transcription of over a hundred downstream acinar genes. PTF1 binds two canonical bipartite sites within a 0.7-kb transcriptional enhancer upstream of Mist1 that are essential for the activity of the enhancer in vivo MIST1 and PTF1 co-regulate target genes synergistically or additively, depending on the target transcriptional enhancer. The frequent close binding proximity of PTF1 and MIST1 in pancreatic acinar cell chromatin implies extensive collaboration, although the collaboration is not dependent on a stable physical interaction.PMID: 27644252Title: Long non-coding RNA IRAIN suppresses apoptosis and promotes proliferation by binding to LSD1 and EZH2 in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Lian Y, Wang J, Feng J, Ding J, Ma Z, Li J, Peng P, De W, Wang KSource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) modulates gene expression, while lncRNA dysregulation is associated with human cancer. Furthermore, while recent studies have shown that lncRNA IRAIN plays an important role in other malignancies, the role of IRAIN in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression remains unclear. In this study, we found that upregulation of lncRNA IRAIN was significantly correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis in a cohort of 37 PC patients. In vitro experiments showed that knockdown of IRAIN by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells. Further mechanism study showed that, by binding to histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), IRAIN reduced PC tumor cell apoptosis and induced growth arrest by silencing the expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and P15. Moreover, IRAIN expression was inversely correlated with that of KLF2 and P15 in PC tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report elucidating the role and mechanism of IRAIN in PC progression.PMID: 27643875Title: Enhancement of Radiation Response in Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Inhibition of Thioredoxin- and Glutathione-Dependent Metabolism.Authors: Rodman SN 3rd, Spence JM, Ronnfeldt TJ, Zhu Y, Solst SR, O'Neill RA, Allen BG, Guan X, Spitz DR, Fath MASource: Radiat Res. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: The goal of this study was to determine if depletion of glutathione (GSH) and inhibition of thioredoxin (Trx) reductase (TrxR) activity could enhance radiation responses in human breast cancer stem cells by a mechanism involving thiol-dependent oxidative stress. The following were used to inhibit GSH and Trx metabolism: buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor; sulfasalazine (SSZ), an inhibitor of xc- cysteine/glutamate antiporter; auranofin (Au), a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor; or 2-AAPA, a GSH-reductase inhibitor. Clonogenic survival, Matrigel assays, flow cytometry cancer stem cell assays (CD44+CD24-ESA+ or ALDH1) and human tumor xenograft models were used to determine the antitumor activity of drug and radiation combinations. Combined inhibition of GSH and Trx metabolism enhanced cancer cell clonogenic killing and radiation responses in human breast and pancreatic cancer cells via a mechanism that could be inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Au, BSO and radiation also significantly decreased breast cancer cell migration and invasion in a thiol-dependent manner that could be inhibited by NAC. In addition, pretreating cells with Au sensitized breast cancer stem cell populations to radiation in vitro as determined by CD44+CD24-ESA+ or ALDH1. Combined administration of Au and BSO, given prior to irradiation, significantly increased the survival of mice with human breast cancer xenografts, and decreased the number of ALDH1+ cancer stem cells. These results indicate that combined inhibition of GSH- and Trx-dependent thiol metabolism using pharmacologically relevant agents can enhance responses of human breast cancer stem cells to radiation both in vitro and in vivo.PMID: 27643769Title: Sunitinib-associated Pancreatic Atrophy in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor: A Toxicity with Prognostic Implications Detected at Imaging.Authors: Shinagare AB, Steele E, Braschi-Amirfarzan M, Tirumani SH, Ramaiya NHSource: Radiology. 2016 Oct;281(1):140-9. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2016152547.Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the effect and clinical importance of sunitinib on pancreatic volume in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors evaluated 65 patients with GIST treated with oral sunitinib and a control group of 30 patients with GIST who did not receive any therapy (mean age: 56 years [range, 29-75 years] vs 60 years [range, 27-78 years], respectively; P = .11) seen at their institution from January 2002 through December 2008. Segmented pancreatic volumes of study and control groups were measured with computed tomography by using commercial software by two independent readers who were blinded to study group and the timing of the scan at a median of 6.2 and 6.1 months, respectively. Pre- and posttreatment volumes (Wilcoxon signed rank test) and rate of volume change per month (Wilcoxon rank sum test) were compared. Interobserver agreement was calculated. Associations and prognostic importance of pancreatic atrophy were studied by using multivariate linear regression and Cox proportional analysis, respectively. Results Both readers recorded significant pancreatic volume loss in the study group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 76.1 cm(3) and 58.4 cm(3) for reader 1 and 67.7 cm(3) and 59.0 cm(3) for reader 2; P < .0001 for both) but not in the control group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 79.9 cm(3) and 83.8 cm(3) for reader 1 [P = .43] and 79.9 cm(3) and 84.8 cm(3) for reader 2 [P = .50]). The rate of volume loss per month was greater in the study group than in the control group (reader 1: -2.1% vs -0.1%, respectively, P = .003; reader 2: -2.0% vs -0.3%, P < .0001). Twenty-three of the 65 patients who received sunitinib (35%) showed at least 3% pancreatic volume loss per month, compared with only one of the 30 patients in the control group (3%). The concordance correlation coefficient for pre- and posttreatment measurements was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.89) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.94), respectively, and the mean relative difference was 0.04% and 1.2%. Sunitinib treatment was independently associated with pancreatic atrophy (P = .03; risk estimate: 2.64; 95% CI: 0.17, 5.11). At Cox proportional analysis within the study group, more than 3%, more than 5%, and more than 7% loss per month were independently associated with worse survival (P < .001, hazard ratio: >1.00 for all). Conclusion Pancreatic atrophy is a sunitinib-associated toxicity detected at imaging. It may be a clinically important biomarker because a higher rate of pancreatic atrophy was independently associated with shorter survival.

Such carcinogen-induced tumors may evade this immune response through "immunoediting," whereby tumors adapt to immune pressure and escape T cell-mediated killing. Many tumors lack a high neoepitope burden, and it remains unclear whether immunoediting occurs in such cases. Here, we evaluated T cell immunity in an autochthonous mouse model of pancreatic cancer and found a low mutational burden, absence of predicted neoepitopes derived from tumor mutations, and resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy. Spontaneous tumor progression was identical in the presence or absence of T cells. Moreover, tumors arising in T cell-depleted mice grew unchecked in immune-competent hosts. However, introduction of the neoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) led to tumor rejection and T cell memory, but this did not occur in OVA immune-tolerant mice. Thus, immunoediting does not occur in this mouse model - a likely consequence, not a cause, of absent neoepitopes. Because many human tumors also have a low missense mutational load and minimal neoepitope burden, our findings have clinical implications for the design of immunotherapy for patients with such tumors.PMID: 27642007Title: Prognostic value of occult tumor cells obtained by peritoneal lavage in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and no ascites: A systematic review.Authors: Steen W, Blom R, Busch O, Gerhards M, Besselink M, Dijk F, Festen SSource: J Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1002/jso.24402.Abstract: The poor survival of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer might be related to the presence of occult peritoneal tumor cells (OPTC). This systematic review studies the prognostic value of cytology and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peritoneal fluid. The results suggest that presence of OPTC is related to a worse survival in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Future studies should investigate its possible role in selecting patients for specific treatment strategies. J. Surg. Oncol.

In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of tricellulin, which constitutes tricellular TJs, using human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In well-differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues, tricellulin immunostaining was prominent in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. In contrast, in poorly differentiated tissues, its immunostaining was predominantly observed in the nuclei and was almost absent in the plasma membrane. The distinct immunostaining of tricellulin successfully distinguished poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma from moderately and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Nuclear tricellulin expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion and poor survival. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, tricellulin localization shifted from the membrane to nucleus with decreasing differentiation status. Nuclear localization of tricellulin promoted cell proliferation and invasiveness possibly in association with MAPK and PKC pathways in pancreatic cancers. Our results provide new insights into the function of tricellulin, and its nuclear localization may become a new prognostic factor for pancreatic cancers.PMID: 27641330Title: Translational research in neuroendocrine tumors: pitfalls and opportunities.Authors: Capdevila J, Casanovas O, Salazar R, Castellano D, Segura A, Fuster P, Aller J, Garcia-Carbonero R, Jimenez-Fonseca P, Grande E, Castano JPSource: Oncogene. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.316.Abstract: Interest in research on neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) has grown in the past 10 years, coinciding with improvements in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NETs. In addition, NETs have become one of the most exciting settings for drug development. Two targeted agents for the management of advanced pancreatic NETs have been approved, but the development of targeted agents for NETs is limited by problems with both patient selection and demonstration of activity. In this review, we analyze these limitations and discuss ways to increase the predictive value of preclinical models for target discovery and drug development. The role of translational research and 'omics' methodologies is emphasized, with the final aim of developing personalized medicine. Because NETs usually grow slowly and metastatic tumors are found at easily accessible locations, and owing to improvements in techniques for liquid biopsies, NETs provide a unique opportunity to obtain tumor samples at all stages of the evolution of the disease and to adapt treatment to changes in tumor biology. Combining clinical and translational research is essential to achieve progress in the NET field. Slow growth and genetic stability limit and challenge both the availability and further development of preclinical models of NETs, one of the most crucial unmet research needs in the field. Finally, we suggest some useful approaches for improving clinical drug development for NETs: moving from classical RECIST-based response end points to survival parameters; searching for different criteria to define response rates (for example, antiangiogenic effects and metabolic responses); implementing randomized phase II studies to avoid single-arm phase II studies that produce limited data on drug efficacy; and using predictive biomarkers for patient selection.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.316.PMID: 27641067Title: New player in tumor-stromal interaction: Granulin as a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma liver metastasis.Authors: Sato-Matsubara M, Kawada NSource: Hepatology. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1002/hep.28849.Abstract: Nielsen SR, Quaranta V, Linford A, et al.1 (Macrophage-secreted granulin supports pancreatic cancer metastasis by inducing liver fibrosis. Nat Cell Biol. 2016;18:549-60) recently described a new mechanism for the tumor-stromal interaction in the metastatic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the liver via granulin that is secreted by metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs).1 MAM-derived granulin transactivates hepatic stellate cells (hStCs), which leads to the production of periostin and extracellular matrix (ECM) at the metastatic site. The present report emphasizes the importance of the interaction between MAMs and hStCs-derived myofibroblasts (MFs) through granulin and periostin in the development of the metastatic microenvironment and suggests that these factors are potential drug targets against PDAC liver metastasis.

METHODS: A total of 1063 serum samples from 303 patients with PaC were collected, and the expression level of miR-25 was measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: We found that miR-25 had significant diagnostic value for the differential diagnosis of PaC in normal controls with an AUC (the area under the ROC curve) of 0.915 (95% CI: 0.893-0.937) that was significantly higher compared with an AUC of 0.725 for serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and an AUC of 0.844 for CA19-9. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that serum miR-25 has strong potential as a novel biomarker for the early detection of PaC.PMID: 27639564Title: Cross sectional and nuclear medicine imaging of pancreatic insulinomas.Authors: Rayamajhi SJ, Lee J, Mittal BR, Jessop AC, Chasen B, Bhosale PSource: Abdom Radiol (NY). 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors which occur predominantly in the pancreas. Although majority of the insulinomas are benign, over-secretion of insulin by the tumor leads to debilitating hypoglycemic symptoms. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical findings. After the diagnosis is made, the principal challenge lies in locating the tumor because most tumors are solitary and small in size. Locating the tumor is of paramount importance as complete surgical excision is the only curative treatment, and incomplete resection leads to persistence of symptoms. Different preoperative and intraoperative imaging techniques have been used with varying success rates for the insulinoma imaging. Besides localizing the tumor, imaging also helps to guide biopsy, detect metastatic lesions, and perform image-guided therapeutic procedures. This review will discuss the role of different Cross sectional and nuclear medicine imaging modalities in insulinomas.PMID: 27639167Title: Hes1 Controls Exocrine Cell Plasticity and Restricts Development of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in a Mouse Model.Authors: Hidalgo-Sastre A, Brodylo RL, Lubeseder-Martellato C, Sipos B, Steiger K, Lee M, von Figura G, Grunwald B, Zhong S, Trajkovic-Arsic M, Neff F, Schmid RM, Siveke JTSource: Am J Pathol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0002-9440(16)30310-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2016.07.025.Abstract: Perturbation of the pancreatic acinar cell state can lead to acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), which is a precursor lesion to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the pancreas, Notch signaling is active both during development and in adult cellular differentiation processes. Hes1, a key downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, is expressed in the centroacinar compartment of the adult pancreas as well as in both preneoplastic and malignant lesions. In this study, we used a murine genetic in vivo approach to ablate Hes1 in pancreatic progenitor cells (Ptf1a+/Cre; Hes1fl/fl). Using this model, we studied the role of Hes1 in both acinar cell plasticity and pancreatic regeneration after caerulein-induced pancreatitis and in KrasG12D-driven PDAC development. We show that, although pancreatic development is not perturbed on the deletion of Hes1, terminal acinar differentiation in the adult pancreas is compromised. Moreover, the loss of Hes1 leads to the impaired regeneration of the exocrine compartment, accelerated fatty metaplasia, and persistent ADM after acute caerulein-induced pancreatitis. In KrasG12D-driven carcinogenesis, Hes1 ablation resulted in increased ADM, decreased formation of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias, and accelerated development of PDAC with shortened survival time. In conclusion, Hes1 plays a key role in acinar cell integrity and plasticity on cellular insults. Furthermore, Hes1 is an essential component of the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias-to-PDAC route in KrasG12D-driven mouse pancreatic carcinogenesis.PMID: 27639164Title: Cellular Prion Protein Mediates Pancreatic Cancer Cell Survival and Invasion through Association with and Enhanced Signaling of Notch1.Authors: Wang Y, Yu S, Huang D, Cui M, Hu H, Zhang L, Wang W, Parameswaran N, Jackson M, Osborne B, Bedogni B, Li C, Sy MS, Xin W, Zhou LSource: Am J Pathol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0002-9440(16)30290-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2016.07.010.Abstract: Up-regulation of human prion protein (PrP) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of PrP-mediated tumorigenesis is not completely understood. In this study, we found that PDAC cell lines can be divided into either PrP high expresser or PrP low expresser. In addition to filamin A (FLNA), PrP interacts with Notch1, forming a PrP/FLNA/Notch1 complex. Silencing PrP in high-expresser cells decreases Notch1 expression and Notch1 signaling. These cells exhibited decreased proliferation, xenograft growth, and tumor invasion but show increased tumor apoptosis. These phenotypes were rescued by ectopically expressed and activated Notch1. By contrast, overexpression of PrP in low expressers increases Notch1 expression and signaling, enhances proliferation, and increases tumor invasion and xenograft growth that can be blocked by a Notch inhibitor. Our data further suggest that PrP increases Notch1 stability likely through suppression of Notch proteosome degradation. Additionally, we found that targeting PrP combined with anti-Notch is much more effective than singularly targeted therapy in retarding PDAC growth. Finally, we show that coexpression of PrP and Notch1 confers an even poorer prognosis than PrP expression alone. Taken together, our results have unraveled a novel molecular pathway driven by interactions between PrP and Notch1 in the progression of PDAC, supporting a critical tumor-promoting role of Notch1 in PrP-expressing PDAC tumors.PMID: 27638992Title: Mesenteric vein thrombosis can be safely treated with anticoagulation but is associated with significant sequelae of portal hypertension.Authors: Maldonado TS, Blumberg SN, Sheth SU, Perreault G, Sadek M, Berland T, Adelman MA, Rockman CBSource: J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord. 2016 Oct;4(4):400-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jvsv.2016.05.003. Epub 2016 Jun 16.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a relatively uncommon but potentially lethal condition associated with bowel ischemia and infarction. The natural history and long-term outcomes are poorly understood and under-reported. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of noncirrhotic patients diagnosed with MVT from 1999 to 2015 was performed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and radiology codes. Patients were excluded if no radiographic imaging was available for review. Eighty patients were identified for analysis. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data on presentation and at long-term follow-up were collected. Long-term sequelae of portal venous hypertension were defined as esophageal varices, portal vein cavernous transformation, splenomegaly, or hepatic atrophy, as seen on follow-up imaging. RESULTS: There were 80 patients (57.5% male; mean age, 57.9 +/- 15.6 years) identified; 83.3% were symptomatic, and 80% presented with abdominal pain. Median follow-up was 480 days (range, 1-6183 days). Follow-up radiographic and clinical data were available for 50 patients (62.5%). The underlying causes of MVT included cancer (41.5%), an inflammatory process (25.9%), the postoperative state (20.7%), and idiopathic cases (18.8%). Pancreatic cancer was the most common associated malignant neoplasm (53%), followed by colon cancer (15%). Twenty patients (26%) had prior or concurrent lower extremity deep venous thromboses. Most patients (68.4%) were treated with anticoagulation; the rest were treated expectantly. Ten (12.5%) had bleeding complications related to anticoagulation, including one death from intracranial hemorrhage. Four patients underwent intervention (three pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and one thrombectomy). One patient died of intestinal ischemia. Two patients had recurrent MVT, both on discontinuing anticoagulation. Long-term imaging sequelae of portal hypertension were noted in 25 of 50 patients (50%) who had follow-up imaging available. Patients with long-term sequelae had lower recanalization rates (36.8% vs 65%; P = .079) and significantly higher rates of complete as opposed to partial thrombosis at the initial event (73% vs 43.3%; P < .005). Long-term sequelae were unrelated to the initial cause or treatment with anticoagulation (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of MVT are associated with malignant disease or an inflammatory process, such as pancreatitis. A diagnosis of malignant disease in the setting of MVT has poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival of only 25%. MVT can be effectively treated with anticoagulation in the majority of cases. Operative or endovascular intervention is rarely needed but important to consider in patients with signs of severe ischemia or impending bowel infarction. There is a significant incidence of radiographically noted long-term sequelae from MVT related to portal venous hypertension, especially in cases of initial complete thrombosis of the mesenteric vein.PMID: 27638830Title: MiR-377 inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic cancer by targeting Pim-3.Authors: Chang W, Liu M, Xu J, Fu H, Zhou B, Yuan T, Chen PSource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of various tumor biological processes including proliferation and apoptosis. MiR-377 has been implicated in many types of cancer, whereas its expressional feature and potential biological function in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. In this study, we scanned the global miRNA expression profiles in PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found miR-377 was down-regulated significantly in PDAC. Then, its expression was measured in both pancreatic cancer tissues and cells; the data showed that miR-377 was de-regulated and inversely correlated with pathologic parameters of tumor growth or metastasis. We generated PDAC cell lines with stable overexpression or inhibition of miR-377, and our results indicated that miR-377 up-regulation significantly promoted cell viability, proliferation, and migration in PDAC cells, and also induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest simultaneously. Binding-site predictions by bioinformatics showed that Pim-3 might be a potential target of miR-377. Luciferase reporter assay ulteriorly identified that miR-377 suppressed Pim-3 expression by binding the 3'-UTR. In tumor tissues, we also showed that the Pim-3 expression was inversely correlated with that of miR-377. Furthermore, stable ectopic miR-377 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines suppressed Pim-3 expression, leading to the attenuation of Bad phosphorylation level at its Ser112 and promoting cell apoptosis. Overall, these results reveal that miR-377 may have tumor growth suppression function by down-regulating Pim-3 kinase expression to inhibit both pancreatic tumor growth and migration, and induce cell apoptosis. Hence, miR-377 may be a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.PMID: 27638678Title: 18F-FDG PET/CT Volumetric Parameters are Associated with Tumor Grade and Metastasis in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors in von Hippel-Lindau Disease.Authors: Satoh K, Sadowski SM, Dieckmann W, Quezado M, Nilubol N, Kebebew E, Patel DSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 8-17 % of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome develop pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), with 11-20 % developing metastases. Tumor grade is predictive of prognosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if preoperative metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were associated with metastatic disease and tumor grade. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with VHL-associated PNETs prospectively underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). MTV, TLG, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were measured using a semi-automatic method. Surgically resected PNETs were classified according to 2010 World Health Organization tumor grade classification. MTV, TLG, and SUVmax were analyzed by metastatic disease and tumor grade using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: A total of 88 PNETs were identified by CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT, 10 of which were non-FDG-avid. Histologic grading was available for 20 surgical patients. Patients with metastatic PNETs had a higher TLG (median 25.9 vs. 7.7 mean SUV [SUVmean]*mL; p = 0.0092) compared with patients without metastasis, while patients with grade 2 PNETs had a higher MTV (median 6.9 vs. 2.6 mL; p = 0.034) and TLG (median 41.2 vs. 13.1 SUVmean*mL; p = 0.0035) compared with patients with grade 1 PNETs. No difference in tumor size or SUVmax was observed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with metastatic PNETs have a higher TLG compared with patients without metastasis. Grade 2 PNETs have a higher MTV and TLG compared with grade 1 PNETs. Tumor size and SUVmax were not associated with grade. Volumetric parameters on 18F-FDG PET/CT may be useful in detecting higher grade PNETs with a higher malignant potential that may need surgical intervention.PMID: 27638677Title: The Half-Life of Serum Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin Is a Prognostic Index of Survival and Recurrence After Liver Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Authors: Okamura Y, Sugiura T, Ito T, Yamamoto Y, Ashida R, Uesaka KSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is a representative tumor marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its values are occasionally very high in HCC cases. The current study aimed to clarify the postoperative half-life of DCP as a prognostic factor. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 177 patients who had undergone liver resection as an initial treatment for HCC. Three DCP half-life groups were defined as follows: within the normal range, half-life shorter than 4 days, and half-life of 4 days or longer. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates were estimated and compared among the three groups. RESULTS: There were 140 patients in the group with a DCP half-life in the normal range, 19 patients in the group with a DCP half-life shorter 4 days, and 18 patients in the group with a DCP half-life of 4 days or longer. A multivariate analysis showed that only a postoperative DCP half-life of 4 days or longer was an independent prognostic risk factor for overall and recurrence-free survival (respective hazard ratios of 2.92 and 4.19; P < 0.001). The group with a preoperative DCP value lower than 1400 mAU/mL, the median value of DCP in the current study, included no patients from the group with a half-life shorter than 4 days. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates in the group with a half-life of 4 days or longer were significantly poorer (P < 0.001) than in the group that had a half-life shorter than 4 days (P = 0.002) with a preoperative DCP status of 1400 mAU/mL or more. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed for the first time that a prolonged half-life of DCP is an independent prognostic risk factor for survival and recurrence after liver resection with curative intent.PMID: 27638672Title: Skeletal Muscle Quality is Associated with Worse Survival After Pancreatoduodenectomy for Periampullary, Nonpancreatic Cancer.Authors: Van Rijssen LB, van Huijgevoort NC, Coelen RJ, Tol JA, Haverkort EB, Nio CY, Busch OR, Besselink MGSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 8.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Body composition measures may predict outcomes of cancer surgery. Whereas low muscle mass shown on preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans has been associated with worse outcomes after surgery for pancreatic cancer, less consideration has been given to low muscle attenuation, reflecting poor muscle quality. Studies relating muscle mass and muscle attenuation with outcomes for patients with periampullary, nonpancreatic cancer are lacking. METHODS: Skeletal muscle mass and attenuation were assessed in 166 consecutive patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for periampullary, nonpancreatic cancer at a single center between 2000 and 2012. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated from cross-sectional muscle area on preoperative CT imaging at the third lumbar vertebra level (L3) and normalized for height. The skeletal muscle attenuation index (MAI) was calculated by measuring the average Hounsfield units of the total muscle area at the L3 level. Overall survival (OS) and the rate of major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo >/=3) were extracted from prospectively maintained databases. RESULTS: Low SMI was present in 78.3 % and low MAI in 48.8 % of the patients. The multivariate analysis showed lymph node metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9], microscopic radicality (HR 2.0; 95 % CI 1.2-3.4), and low MAI (HR 2.0; 95 % CI 1.2-3.3), but not low SMI to be significantly associated with decreased OS. Low MAI (HR 1.9; 95 % CI 1.0-3.8) was the only independent risk factor for major postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Skeletal muscle quality, but not muscle mass, predicted survival and major complications after PD for periampullary, nonpancreatic cancer. Preoperative CT-derived body composition measures may stratify patients into risk categories and support shared decision making.PMID: 27638624Title: Portal Vein Thrombosis After Splenic and Pancreatic Surgery.Authors: Ruiz-Tovar J, Priego PSource: Adv Exp Med Biol. 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: The portal vein is formed by the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, which drain the spleen and small intestine respectively. Occlusion of the portal vein by thrombus typically occurs in patients with cirrhosis and/or prothrombotic disorders. However, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) can also happen after determined surgeries. Moreover, PVT can have serious consequences depending on the location and extent of the thrombosis, including hepatic ischemia, intestinal ischemia, portal hypertension... In this chapter, we will review the incidence, management and prophylaxis of PVT after splenectomy, pancreas transplantation, pancreatic surgery and in the setting of acute and chronic pancreatitis.PMID: 27638187Title: Pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: Epidemiology and outcomes.Authors: Doulamis IP, Mylonas KS, Kalfountzos CE, Mou D, Haj-Ibrahim H, Nasioudis DSource: Int J Surg. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S1743-9191(16)30865-2. doi: 10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.09.017.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare malignancy. Our aim was to investigate the demographic, pathological characteristics, treatment modalities and survival of patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma via the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based study of SEER database's records on patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma diagnosed from 1988 to 2012. Primary outcome measures were clinico-pathological characteristics, observed survival and disease-specific survival of patients. RESULTS: A total of 507 patients were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years and most patients were female (68.4%). The tumors were mainly low grade (82.9%, grade I-II) and frequently localized (42.8%) in the body/tail of the pancreas (45.6%). According to Kaplan-Meier curves observed survival was 111 months (95%CI: 82.5, 139.5) vs 14 months (95% CI: 10.9, 17.1) vs 4 months (95%CI: 2.9, 5.1) for patients with localized, regional and distant disease, respectively. One-year disease-specific survival for patients with localized disease was 90.1%, vs. 56.7% for those with regional and 18.7% with distant tumor spread. CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous cystadenocarcinomas tend to be low grade tumors, localized to the pancreatic body/tail. Surgery as the primary therapeutic intervention and tumor stage are independent predictors of disease-specific survival.PMID: 27637888Title: Mutant p53 Together with TGFbeta Signaling Influence Organ-Specific Hematogenous Colonization Patterns of Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Zhong Y, Macgregor-Das AM, Saunders T, Whittle M, Makohon-Moore A, Kohutek Z, Poling J, Herbst B, Javier B, Cope L, Leach SD, Hingorani SR, Iacobuzio-Donahue CASource: Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 16. pii: clincanres.1615.2015.Abstract: PURPOSE: TP53 and the TGFbeta pathway are major mediators of pancreatic cancer metastasis. The mechanisms by which they cause hematogenous metastasis have not been fully explored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: KPC (LSL-KRASG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Ptf1aCre/+) mice were generated and the frequency and morphology of organ-specific hematogenous metastases compared to that seen in KPTC and KTC littermates (Tgfbr2+/-). Key findings were validated in primary cells from each genotype and samples of human pancreatic cancer liver metastases. RESULTS: The frequency of hematogenous metastasis in KPTC mice was significantly lower than for KPC mice (41% vs 68%, p<0.05), largely due to a reduction in liver metastases. No differences were found between KPC and KPTC lung metastases whereas liver metastases in KPTC mice showed a profound extravasation deficiency characterized by sinusoidal growth and lack of desmoplastic stroma. Analogous findings were confirmed in liver samples from patients indicating their clinical relevance. Portal vein colonization as a direct mode of access to the liver was observed in both mice and humans. Secretome analyses of KPC cells revealed an abundance of secreted prometastatic mediators including Col6A1 and Lcn2 that promoted early steps of metastatic colonization. These mediators were overexpressed in primary tumors but not metastases suggesting the ability to colonize is in part developed within the primary site, a phenomenon we refer to as the "Cinderella effect". CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a novel paradigm for understanding pancreatic cancer metastasis and the observed clinical latencies of liver versus lung metastases specifically.PMID: 27637822Title: Clinical pathway for esophagectomy improves perioperative nutrition.Authors: Raman V, Kaiser LR, Erkmen CPSource: Healthc (Amst). 2016 Sep;4(3):166-72. doi: 10.1016/j.hjdsi.2015.11.004. Epub 2015 Dec 30.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical pathways reduce hospitalization and costs in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We describe creating an esophagectomy pathway and analyze its implementation and effects. METHODS: We documented the process of developing an esophagectomy clinical pathway. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 12 patients before pathway implementation and 12 patients after. RESULTS: Pathway Implementation: more patients were presented at tumor board (9 pathway vs. 2 pre-pathway; p=0.012) and chose their postoperative care facility before surgery (8 vs. 0; p=0.0013) OUTCOMES: There were no changes in mortality (0 vs. 0), major complications (5 vs. 5), hospitalization (median 9.5 vs. 12 days; p=0.82), and total charges ($ 98,395 vs. $ 96,946; p=0.96). Pathway patients lost significantly less weight preoperatively (2.3% vs. 7.6%; p=0.01) and perioperatively (6.3% vs. 12%; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the process of designing and implementing an esophagectomy pathway. While there was no significant decrease in mortality, complications, hospitalization, or charges, our pathway significantly decreased pre- and perioperative weight loss, which we attribute to coordinated patient education and care.PMID: 27637757Title: Economic Evaluations of First-Line Chemotherapy Regimens for Pancreatic Cancer: A Critical Review.Authors: Gharaibeh M, Bootman JL, McBride A, Martin J, Abraham ISource: Pharmacoeconomics. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: Effect sizes of efficacy of first-line treatments for (metastatic) pancreas cancer are constrained, underscoring the need for evaluations of the efficacy-to-cost relationship. We critically review economic evaluations of first-line chemotherapy regimens for pancreatic cancer since the 1997 introduction of gemcitabine. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE (1997-2015), and the websites of health technology assessment agencies. Two authors independently reviewed economic studies for eligibility in this review; evaluated peer-reviewed, journal-published studies in terms of the Drummond Checklist; and critiqued the technical and scientific merit of all studies. Sixteen pharmacoeconomic evaluations were included: ten published in nine peer-reviewed journals and six on three websites. Six were on single-agent therapies and ten on combination therapies. Analyses conducted included cost-effectiveness (three studies), cost-utility (one study), or combined cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (12 studies). Studies diverged in results, mainly because of different assumptions, methods, inputs, and country-specific guidelines. The two most recent regimens, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (NAB-P + GEM) and the combination of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX), were evaluated in an indirect comparison, yielding a statistically similar benefit in overall survival but superior progression-free survival for FOLFIRINOX. NAB-P + GEM showed greater economic benefit over FOLFIRINOX. In conclusion, the divergence in results observed across studies is attributable to economic drivers that are specific to countries and their healthcare (financing) systems. No recommendations regarding the relative economic benefit of treatment regimens, general or country-specific, are made as the purpose of pharmacoeconomic analysis is to inform policy decision-making and clinical practice, not set policy or define clinical practice.PMID: 27637154Title: Meta-analysis of CYP2E1 polymorphisms in liver carcinogenesis.Authors: Fu P, Yang F, Li B, Zhang B, Guan L, Sheng J, Ye Y, Wang Z, Li P, Xu L, Zou L, Li WSource: Dig Liver Dis. 2016 Aug 18. pii: S1590-8658(16)30691-0. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2016.08.114.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The CYP2E1 protein is a monooxygenase with certain polymorphisms linked to liver cancer. However, results from individual studies remain controversial. AIMS: To evaluate CYP2E1 polymorphisms in liver carcinogenesis through meta-analysis. METHODS: All studies about CYP2E1 polymorphisms and liver cancer were retrieved from seven major databases. Original data from each study were pooled and re-analyzed. RESULTS: Total of 16 articles with 4862 cases were selected, including 1820 cases of liver cancer and 3042 cases of controls. The c1 allelic frequency in the cases and controls was 83.3% and 85.3%, respectively. Five genetic variations were compared: dominant c1c2/c2c2 vs. c1/c1 (OR=0.987 (0.853, 1.141)), homozygous c2c2 vs. c1c1 (OR=0.767 (0.526, 1.119)), heterozygous c1c2 vs. c1c1 (OR=1.005 (0.854, 1.182)), recessive c2c2 vs. c1c2/c2c2 (OR=0.771 (0.530, 1.122)), and different alleles c2 vs. c1 (OR=0.947 (0.828, 1.082)). Pooled data were further analyzed based on ethnicity, control sources, and HWE (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). These results from stratified groups were similar to that of nonstratified groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis results suggest that there is no evidence for a major role of CYP2E1 polymorphism in liver carcinogenesis, but do not rule out the possibility in certain cases.PMID: 27637085Title: Dual Oxidase2 and pancreatic adenocarcinoma: IFN-gamma-mediated dual oxidase2 overexpression results in H2O2-induced, ERKassociated up-regulation of HIF-1alpha and VEGF-A.Authors: Wu Y, Meitzler JL, Antony S, Juhasz A, Lu J, Jiang G, Liu H, Hollingshead M, Haines DC, Butcher D, Panter MS, Roy K, Doroshow JHSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12032.Abstract: Several NADPH oxidase family members, including dual oxidase 2 [DUOX2], are expressed in human tumors, particularly gastrointestinal cancers associated with long-standing chronic inflammation. We found previously that exposure of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma increased DUOX2 expression (but not other NADPH oxidases) leading to long-lived H2O2 production. To elucidate the pathophysiology of DUOX2-mediated H2O2 formation in the pancreas further, we demonstrate here that IFN-gamma-treated BxPC-3 and CFPAC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (known to increase DUOX2 expression) produce significant levels of intracellular oxidants and extracellular H2O2 which correlate with concomitant up-regulation of VEGF-A and HIF-1alpha transcription. These changes are not observed in the PANC-1 line that does not increase DUOX2 expression following IFN-gamma treatment. DUOX2 knockdown with short interfering RNA significantly decreased IFN-gamma-induced VEGF-A or HIF-1alpha up-regulation, as did treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium, the multifunctional reduced thiol N-acetylcysteine, and the polyethylene glycol-modified form of the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying enzyme catalase. Increased DUOX2-related VEGF-A expression appears to result from reactive oxygen-mediated activation of ERK signaling that is responsible for AP-1-related transcriptional effects on the VEGF-A promoter. To clarify the relevance of these observations in vivo, we demonstrate that many human pre-malignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms and frank pancreatic cancers express substantial levels of DUOX protein compared to histologically normal pancreatic tissues, and that expression of both DUOX2 and VEGF-A mRNAs is significantly increased in surgically-resected pancreatic cancers compared to the adjacent normal pancreas.PMID: 27636991Title: Oxidized macrophage migration inhibitory factor is a potential new tissue marker and drug target in cancer.Authors: Schinagl A, Thiele M, Douillard P, Volkel D, Kenner L, Kazemi Z, Freissmuth M, Scheiflinger F, Kerschbaumer RJSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11970.Abstract: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, which was shown to be upregulated in cancers and to exhibit tumor promoting properties. Unlike other cytokines, MIF is ubiquitously present in the circulation and tissue of healthy subjects. We recently described a previously unrecognized, disease-related isoform of MIF, designated oxMIF, which is present in the circulation of patients with different inflammatory diseases. In this article, we report that oxMIF is also linked to different solid tumors as it is specifically expressed in tumor tissue from patients with colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer. Furthermore, oxMIF can be specifically targeted by a subset of phage display-derived fully human, monoclonal anti-MIF antibodies (mAbs) that were shown to neutralize pro-tumorigenic activities of MIF in vivo. We further demonstrate that anti-oxMIF mAbs sensitize human cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, A2780 and A2780ADR) to the action of cytotoxic drugs (mitoxantrone, cisplatin and doxorubicin) in vitro and in an A2780 xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. We conclude that oxMIF is the disease related isoform of MIF in solid tumors and a potential new diagnostic marker and drug target in cancer.PMID: 27636547Title: Appraisal of Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy for Left-Sided Pancreatic Cancer: A Large Volume Cohort Study of 152 Consecutive Patients.Authors: Shin SH, Kim SC, Song KB, Hwang DW, Lee JH, Park KM, Lee YJSource: PLoS One. 2016 Sep 16;11(9):e0163266. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163266. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to appraise the value of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) for left-sided pancreatic cancer based on a large volume cohort study. METHODS: We reviewed data for all consecutive patients undergoing LDP for left-sided pancreatic cancer at Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) between December 2006 and December 2014. RESULTS: A total of 91 male and 61 female patients, with a median age of 62.7 years were included in this study. The median operative duration was 234 minutes. Pathological reports revealed the following: a median tumor size of 3.0 cm (range, 0.4-10.0), T stages (T1 in 7.9%, T2 in 5.3%, T3 in 86.8%, and no T4), the tumor differentiation (well differentiated in 16.4%, moderately differentiated in 75.4%, and poorly differentiated in 8.2%), and R0 resection in 126 patients (82.9%). After pancreatectomy, 96 patients (63.2%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and the median time to chemotherapy was 30 days. The median length of hospital stay was 8 days (range, 5-31), and the median time to diet resumption was 1 day. Grade B or C postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred in 14 patients (9.2%) and grade II or III complications occurred in 27 (17.7%). The median overall survival was 43.0 months. A Cox proportional hazards model showed that tumor size, N1 stage, combined resection, and incompleteness of planned adjuvant chemotherapy affect patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: LDP for left-sided pancreatic cancer is reasonable within selected indications. An international consensus on laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic cancer would be desirable and timely.PMID: 27636545Title: ROS in translation: chink in the armor.Authors: Chio II, Tuveson DASource: Cell Cycle. 2016 Sep 16:0.Abstract: ?PMID: 27635275Title: Management and Reconstruction of a Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma Patient Three Years after Pancreaticoduodenectomy: A Surgical Puzzle.Authors: Dellaportas D, Gossage JA, Davies ARSource: Case Rep Surg. 2016;2016:5650382. doi: 10.1155/2016/5650382. Epub 2016 Aug 18.Abstract: Introduction. With the improving survival of cancer patients, the development of a secondary primary cancer is an increasingly common phenomenon. Extensive surgery during initial treatment may pose significant challenges to surgeons managing the second primary cancer. Case Presentation. A 69-year-old male, who had a pancreaticoduodenectomy three years ago for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, underwent an uneventful extended total gastrectomy for gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma. The reconstruction controversies and considerations are highlighted. Discussion. Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are common for several gastrointestinal malignancies. However, the occurrence of a second unfavorable cancer such as gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma after pancreatic head cancer treatment is extremely uncommon. This clinical scenario possesses numerous difficulties for the surgeon, since surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for both malignancies. Gastrointestinal reconstruction becomes challenging and requires careful planning and meticulous surgical technique along with sound intraoperative judgement.PMID: 27635171Title: Whole-Body MRI Screening in Asymptomatic Subjects; Preliminary Experience and Long-Term Follow-Up Findings.Authors: Ulus S, Suleyman E, Ozcan UA, Karaarslan ESource: Pol J Radiol. 2016 Aug 30;81:407-14. doi: 10.12659/PJR.897570. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to describe the technique and to evaluate the results of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in an asymptomatic population. MATERIAL/METHODS: Between March 2009 and December 2011, 118 consecutive subjects undergoing thorough medical check-up were prospectively included in the study. MRI was performed with a 205-cm moving table, parallel imaging and automatic image composing software. RESULTS: In 83 subjects (70%), 103 benign lesions were detected. Two malignant (adrenal and renal carcinoma) lesions and one precancerous (pancreatic mucinous carcinoma) lesion were detected. The most common lesions were renal cysts, liver hemangiomas, liver cysts, thyroid nodules, and uterine leiomyomas. CONCLUSIONS: WB-MRI is able to cover area from head to toes in one diagnostic work-up, and besides the anatomic regions evaluated by conventional radiological modalities, i.e. brain parenchyma, bones and extremities, can be evaluated in one examination.PMID: 27634903Title: Early tumor shrinkage as a predictor of favorable outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX.Authors: Kaga Y, Sunakawa Y, Kubota Y, Tagawa T, Yamamoto T, Ikusue T, Uto Y, Miyashita K, Toshima H, Kobayashi K, Hisamatsu A, Ichikawa W, Sekikawa T, Shimada K, Sasaki YSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12007.Abstract: There are several reports on the correlation between early tumor shrinkage (ETS) or depth of response (DpR) and survival in chemotherapies for colorectal cancer; however, few studies have investigated it in pancreatic cancer. We therefore investigated whether the ETS will predict outcomes in 59 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX therapy. The association of ETS with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated but also we addressed to the correlation between outcomes and DpR. ETS was defined as a reduction >/= 20% of target lesions' diameters measured at 6 to 8 weeks from treatment start. DpR was percentage of maximal tumor shrinkage observed at the nadir diameter compared with baseline. Among 47 evaluable patients for the ETS, 12 (25.5%) patients experienced ETS. The ETS was significantly associated with better PFS (9.0 vs. 4.2 months) as well as OS (24.0 vs. 9.1 months); moreover, the association had a statistically significance for PFS but a strong trend for OS in multivariate analysis. The DpR was statistically significantly but weakly associated with OS. In conclusion, this is the first report that the early response to chemotherapy may predict favorable outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX therapy.PMID: 27634878Title: Blocking downstream signaling pathways in the context of HDAC inhibition promotes apoptosis preferentially in cells harboring mutant Ras.Authors: Bahr JC, Robey RW, Luchenko V, Basseville A, Chakraborty AR, Kozlowski H, Pauly GT, Patel P, Schneider JP, Gottesman MM, Bates SESource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12001.Abstract: We previously demonstrated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in a series of romidepsin-selected T-cell lymphoma cell lines as a mechanism of resistance to the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI), romidepsin. As Ras mutation leads to activation of both the MAPK and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, we examined whether combining romidepsin with small molecule pathway inhibitors would lead to increased apoptosis in cancers harboring Ras mutations. We treated 18 Ras mutant or wild-type cell lines with romidepsin in the presence of a MEK inhibitor (PD-0325901) and/or an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) and examined apoptosis by flow cytometry. A short-term treatment schedule of romidepsin (25 ng/ml for 6 h) was used to more closely model clinical administration. Romidepsin in combination with a MEK and an AKT inhibitor induced apoptosis preferentially in cells harboring mutant versus wild-type Ras (69.1% vs. 21.1%, p < 0.0001). Similar results were found in a subset of cell lines when belinostat was combined with the MEK and AKT inhibitors and when romidepsin was combined with the dual extracellular signaling-related kinase (ERK)/PI3K inhibitor, D-87503, which inhibited both the MAPK and PI3K pathways at 5-10 muM. The observed apoptosis was caspase-dependent and required Bak and Bax expression. Cells with wild-type or mutant Ras treated with romidepsin alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor displayed increased expression of proapoptotic Bim. We thus conclude that cancers bearing Ras mutations, such as pancreatic cancer, can be targeted by the combination of an HDI and a dual inhibitor of the MAPK and PI3K pathways.PMID: 27634764Title: Dual roles for CXCL4 chemokines and CXCR3 in angiogenesis and invasion of pancreatic cancer.Authors: Quemener C, Baud J, Boye K, Dubrac A, Billottet C, Soulet F, Darlot F, Dumartin L, Sire M, Grepin R, Daubon T, Rayne F, Wodrich H, Couvelard A, Pineau R, Schilling M, Castronovo V, Sue SC, Clarke K, Lomri A, Khatib AM, Hagedorn M, Prats H, Bikfalvi ASource: Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 9. pii: canres.2864.2015.Abstract: The CXCL4 paralog CXCL4L1 is a little studied chemokine that has been suggested to exert an anti-angiogenic function. However, CXCL4L1 is also expressed in patient tumors, tumor cell lines and murine xenografts, prompting a more detailed analysis of its role in cancer pathogenesis. We used genetic and antibody-based approaches to attenuate CXCL4L1 in models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Mechanisms of expression were assessed in cell co-culture experiments, murine and avian xenotransplants, including through an evaluation of CpG methylation and mutation of critical CpG residues. CXCL4L1 gene expression was increased greatly in primary and metastatic PDAC. We found that myofibroblasts triggered cues in the tumor microenvironment which led to induction of CXCL4L1 in tumor cells. CXCL4L1 expression was also controlled by epigenetic modifications at critical CpG islands which were mapped. CXCL4L1 inhibited vasculogenesis but also affected tumor development more directly depending on the tumor cell type. In vivo administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCL4L1, we demonstrated a blockade in the growth of tumors positive for CXCR3, a critical receptor for CXCL4 ligands. Our findings define a pro-tumorigenic role in PDAC development for endogenous CXCL4L1, which is independent of its anti-angiogenic function.PMID: 27634306Title: Role of Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and Streptozocin Therapy in the Preoperative Treatment of Localized Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.Authors: Prakash L, Bhosale P, Cloyd J, Kim M, Parker N, Yao J, Dasari A, Halperin D, Aloia T, Lee JE, Vauthey JN, Fleming JB, Katz MHSource: J Gastrointest Surg. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: 5-Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and streptozocin (FAS) leads to a 39 % response rate in advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). We sought to validate our hypothesis that preoperative FAS may facilitate resection of locoregionally advanced pNETs by reducing the anatomic extent of the primary tumor. PATIENTS: All patients who received FAS between 2000 and 2012 as initial therapy for a localized pNET were reviewed. Tumor size and vascular relationships were compared on pretreatment and posttreatment imaging studies to quantify treatment response. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients received a median 4 cycles of FAS (range 2-15). Rates of RECIST progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), and partial response (PR) were 3, 90, and 7 %, respectively. An interface was observed between the tumor and a major mesenteric artery and/or vein in 19 (66 %) and 24 (83 %) patients, respectively; after therapy with FAS, 17 (59 %) and 22 (76 %) had persistent interface with artery and/or vein. Fourteen (48 %) patients underwent pancreatectomy, 7 (50 %) required vascular management, and 9 (64 %) operations were R0. The median overall survival of unresected and resected patients was 41 months (95 % CI, 16-66) and 112 months (95 % CI, 104-120) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients receiving FAS for locoregionally advanced pNETs are unlikely to progress during systemic therapy, significant "downstaging" appears uncommon.PMID: 27633819Title: Association between high levels of Notch3 expression and high invasion and poor overall survival rates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Authors: Zhou JX, Zhou L, Li QJ, Feng W, Wang PM, Li EF, Gong WJ, Kou MW, Gou WT, Yang YLSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep 9. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5079.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a commonly fatal tumour. It is characterized by early metastasis and high mortality. Many patients die as a result of PDAC tumour progression. However, the underlying mechanism of invasion and metastasis in PDAC is still not fully understood. Previous studies showed that the Notch signalling pathway may play an important role in the progression of tumour invasion and metastasis. However, it is not yet known whether the Notch signalling pathway participates in the progression of invasion in PDAC. In the present study, immunohistochemistry showed that a high expression of Notch3 was correlated with tumour grade, metastasis, venous invasion and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that a high expression of Notch3 was a significant risk factor for shortened survival time. We also showed that inhibition of Notch3 had an antiinvasion role in PDAC cells. In vitro, the inhibition of Notch3 reduced the migration and invasion capabilities of PDAC cells by regulating the expressions of E-cadherin, CD44v6, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF and uPA via regulating the COX-2 and ERK1/2 pathways. These results indicated that downregulation of the Notch signalling pathway may be a novel and useful approach for preventing and treating PDAC invasion.PMID: 27633518Title: MicroRNA-330-5p negatively regulates ITGA5 expression in human colorectal cancer.Authors: Yoo HI, Kim BK, Yoon SKSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep 15. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5092.Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most prevalent malignant cancers, has high rates pf incidence and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the development of various types of cancers. miRNA330-5p has been implicated in the progression of prostate, neuronal and pancreatic cancers by regulating proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of miR-330-5p in CRC and identify its target gene(s) that may act in CRC tumorigenesis. We found that miR-330-5p expression was significantly lower in CRC tissues than that in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, we identified integrin alpha5 (ITGA5) as a new target of miR-330-5p and found that it inhibits ITGA5 expression by directly binding to the 3' untranslated region of ITGA5 mRNA. These results suggest that downregulation of miR-330-5p expression may affect CRC development via modulation of ITGA5 expression.PMID: 27633013Title: Genetic ablation of Smoothened in pancreatic fibroblasts increases acinar-ductal metaplasia.Authors: Liu X, Pitarresi JR, Cuitino MC, Kladney RD, Woelke SA, Sizemore GM, Nayak SG, Egriboz O, Schweickert PG, Yu L, Trela S, Schilling DJ, Halloran SK, Li M, Dutta S, Fernandez SA, Rosol TJ, Lesinski GB, Shakya R, Ludwig T, Konieczny SF, Leone G, Wu J, Ostrowski MCSource: Genes Dev. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: The contribution of the microenvironment to pancreatic acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), a preneoplastic transition in oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic cancer progression, is currently unclear. Here we show that disruption of paracrine Hedgehog signaling via genetic ablation of Smoothened (Smo) in stromal fibroblasts in a KrasG12D mouse model increased ADM. Smo-deleted fibroblasts had higher expression of transforming growth factor-alpha (Tgfa) mRNA and secreted higher levels of TGFalpha, leading to activation of EGFR signaling in acinar cells and increased ADM. The mechanism involved activation of AKT and noncanonical activation of the GLI family transcription factor GLI2. GLI2 was phosphorylated at Ser230 in an AKT-dependent fashion and directly regulated Tgfa expression in fibroblasts lacking Smo Additionally, Smo-deleted fibroblasts stimulated the growth of KrasG12D/Tp53R172H pancreatic tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. These results define a non-cell-autonomous mechanism modulating KrasG12D-driven ADM that is balanced by cross-talk between Hedgehog/SMO and AKT/GLI2 pathways in stromal fibroblasts.PMID: 27632196Title: Systemic Inflammatory Response and Elevated Tumour Markers Predict Worse Survival in Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.Authors: Salmiheimo A, Mustonen H, Stenman UH, Puolakkainen P, Kemppainen E, Seppanen H, Haglund CSource: PLoS One. 2016 Sep 15;11(9):e0163064. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163064. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Estimation of the prognosis of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) currently relies on tumour-related factors such as resection margins and on lymph-node ratio (LNR) both inconveniently available only postoperatively. Our aim was to assess the accuracy of preoperative laboratory data in predicting PDAC prognosis. METHODS: Collection of laboratory and clinical data was retrospective from 265 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for PDAC at Helsinki University Hospital. Cancer-specific survival assessment utilized Kaplan-Meier analysis, and independent associations between factors were by the Cox regression model. RESULTS: During follow-up, 76% of the patients died of PDAC, with a median survival time of 19.6 months. In univariate analysis, CRP, albumin, CEA, and CA19-9 were significantly associated with postoperative cancer-specific survival. In multivariate analysis, taking into account age, gender, LNR, resection margins, tumour status, and adjuvant chemotherapy, the preoperative biomarkers independently associated with adverse prognosis were hypoalbuminemia (< 36 g/L, hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-2.19, p = 0.011), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L, HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.02, p = 0.036), CEA (> 5 mug/L, HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.07-2.53, p = 0.047), and CA19-9 (>/=555 kU/L, HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.18-3.08, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: For patients with resectable PDAC, preoperative CRP, along with albumin and tumour markers, is useful for predicting prognosis.PMID: 27632152Title: QuickStats: Age-Adjusted Death Rates* for Top Five Causes of Cancer Death,(dagger) by Race/Hispanic Ethnicity - United States, 2014.Authors: ?Source: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016 Sep 16;65(37):989. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6536a10.Abstract: In 2014, the top five causes of cancer deaths for the total population were lung, colorectal, female breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The non-Hispanic black population had the highest age-adjusted death rates for each of these five cancers, followed by non-Hispanic white and Hispanic groups. The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in all groups, was 42.1 per 100,000 standard population for the total population, 45.4 for non-Hispanic white, 45.7 for non-Hispanic black, and 18.3 for Hispanic populations.PMID: 27632063Title: Tbx3 fosters pancreatic cancer growth by increased angiogenesis and activin/nodal-dependent induction of stemness.Authors: Perkhofer L, Walter K, Costa IG, Carrasco MC, Eiseler T, Hafner S, Genze F, Zenke M, Bergmann W, Illing A, Hohwieler M, Kohntop R, Lin Q, Holzmann KH, Seufferlein T, Wagner M, Liebau S, Hermann PC, Kleger A, Muller MSource: Stem Cell Res. 2016 Aug 10;17(2):367-378. doi: 10.1016/j.scr.2016.08.007.Abstract: Cell fate decisions and pluripotency, but also malignancy depend on networks of key transcriptional regulators. The T-box transcription factor TBX3 has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and cardiogenesis. We have recently discovered that forced TBX3 expression in embryonic stem cells promotes mesendoderm specification directly by activating key lineage specification factors and indirectly by enhancing paracrine NODAL signalling. Interestingly, aberrant TBX3 expression is associated with breast cancer and melanoma formation. In other cancers, loss of TBX3 expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype e.g. in gastric and cervical cancer. The precise function of TBX3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains to be determined. In the current study we provide conclusive evidence for TBX3 overexpression in pancreatic cancer samples as compared to healthy tissue. While proliferation remains unaltered, forced TBX3 expression strongly increases migration and invasion, but also angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we describe the TBX3-dependency of cancer stem cells that perpetuate themselves through an autocrine TBX3-ACTIVIN/NODAL signalling loop to sustain stemness. Thus, TBX3 is a new key player among pluripotency-related genes driving cancer formation.PMID: 27631774Title: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio is a Predictive Marker for Invasive Malignancy in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas.Authors: Gemenetzis G, Bagante F, Griffin JF, Rezaee N, Javed AA, Manos LL, Lennon AM, Wood LD, Hruban RH, Zheng L, Zaheer A, Fishman EK, Ahuja N, Cameron JL, Weiss MJ, He J, Wolfgang CLSource: Ann Surg. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values, and the presence of invasive carcinoma in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). BACKGROUND: NLR and (PLR) are inflammatory markers that have been associated with overall survival in patients with invasive malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 272 patients who underwent surgical resection for histologically confirmed IPMN from January 1997 to July 2015. NLR and PLR were calculated and coevaluated with additional demographic, clinical, and imaging data for possible correlation with IPMN-associated carcinoma in the form of a predictive nomogram. RESULTS: NLR and PLR were significantly elevated in patients with IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, NLR value higher than 4 (P < 0.001), IPMN cyst of size more than 3 cm (P < 0.001), presence of enhanced solid component (P = 0.014), main pancreatic duct dilatation of more than 5 mm (P < 0.001), and jaundice (P < 0.001) were statistically significant variables. The developed statistical model has a c-index of 0.895. Implementation of the statistically significant variables in a predictive nomogram provided a reliable point system for estimating the presence of IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent predictive marker for the presence of IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed to assess the predictive ability of NLR and how it can be applied in the clinical setting.PMID: 27631726Title: Plasma miR-22-3p, miR-642b-3p and miR-885-5p as diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.Authors: Hussein NA, Kholy ZA, Anwar MM, Ahmad MA, Ahmad SMSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) by using sensitive and specific biomarkers is considered necessary. MiRNAs are master regulators of gene expression and several biological processes, and they are dysregulated in various cancers, where they play a vital role in either cancer progression or suppression. So, this study was designed to investigate the role of plasma miR-22-3p, miR-642b-3p and miR-885-5p expression as possible diagnostic markers in PC patients as compared to serum CA19-9. In addition, the correlation of those miRNAs and CA19-9 with clinical characteristics of PC patients was analyzed. METHODS: The expression levels of selected miRNAs and serum CA19-9 concentration were determined for 35 patients with PDAC and 15 healthy controls by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and electro-chemiluminescence immune assay, respectively. The sensitivities of miRNAs as biomarkers of PC were evaluated and compared with CA19-9 using a receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The levels of three miRNAs (miR-22-3p, miR-642b-3p and miR-885-5p) and CA19-9 were significantly higher in PC patients, even those with early-stage disease (IB and IIB), than in healthy control. Both miRNAs and CA19-9 were associated with tumor stage. The high sensitivities of the three selected miRNAs and CA19-9 were observed. CONCLUSION: The measurement of miR-22-3p, miR-642b-3p and miR-885-5p may prove to have clinical utility in diagnosis of PC. Those miRNAs are ideal early biomarkers for PC diagnosis. So, they can effectively be used with serum CA19-9 for PC screening in early tumor stage.PMID: 27631521Title: Validation of a Proposed Tumor Regression Grading Scheme for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma After Neoadjuvant Therapy as a Prognostic Indicator for Survival.Authors: Lee SM, Katz MH, Liu L, Sundar M, Wang H, Varadhachary GR, Wolff RA, Lee JE, Maitra A, Fleming JB, Rashid A, Wang HSource: Am J Surg Pathol. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: Neoadjuvant therapy has been increasingly used to treat patients with potentially resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although the College of American Pathologists (CAP) grading scheme for tumor response in posttherapy specimens has been used, its clinical significance has not been validated. Previously, we proposed a 3-tier histologic tumor regression grading (HTRG) scheme (HTRG 0, no viable tumor; HTRG 1, <5% viable tumor cells; HTRG 2, >/=5% viable tumor cells) and showed that the 3-tier HTRG scheme correlated with prognosis. In this study, we sought to validate our proposed HTRG scheme in a new cohort of 167 consecutive PDAC patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy and pancreaticoduodenectomy. We found that patients with HTRG 0 or 1 were associated with a lower frequency of lymph node metastasis (P=0.004) and recurrence (P=0.01), lower ypT (P<0.001) and AJCC stage (P<0.001), longer disease-free survival (DFS, P=0.004) and overall survival (OS, P=0.02) than those with HTRG 2. However, there was no difference in either DFS or OS between the groups with CAP grade 2 and those with CAP grade 3 (P>0.05). In multivariate analysis, HTRG grade 0 or 1 was an independent prognostic factor for better DFS (P=0.03), but not OS. Therefore we validated the proposed HTRG scheme from our previous study. The proposed HTRG scheme is simple and easy to apply in practice by pathologists and might be used as a successful surrogate for longer DFS in patients with potentially resectable PDAC who completed neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.PMID: 27631424Title: Primary Leiomyosarcoma of the Pancreas-a Case Report and a Comprehensive Review.Authors: Soreide JA, Undersrud ES, Al-Saiddi MS, Tholfsen T, Soreide KSource: J Gastrointest Cancer. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: PURPOSE: Primary mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas are rare, with leiomyosarcomas the most encountered entities among the pancreatic sarcomas. With few exceptions, single case reports published over the last six decades constitute the entire scientific literature on this topic. Thus, evidence regarding clinical decision-making is scant. METHODS: Based on a case report and an extensive literature search in PubMed, we discuss the clinical aspects and current management of this rare malignancy. RESULTS: We identified only two papers with more than a single case presentation; these institutional patient series were limited to five and nine patients. Additionally, a few papers sought to summarize the individual case reports published in the English and/or Chinese language. The clinical presentation is rather non-specific. Moreover, modern imaging modalities are insufficiently accurate to diagnose leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. Treatment goals include a complete resection with free margins. Proper morphologic examination using immunohistochemistry and the application of a grading system are clinically important for prognostication. The efficacy of adjuvant treatments has not been established. CONCLUSION: Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcoma is extremely rare, and the scientific literature is primarily based on single case reports. Conclusions on management and prognosis should be drawn with caution. A multidisciplinary team consultation is warranted to discuss a thorough individual treatment plan based on the available scientific literature, despite its low evidence level.PMID: 27631326Title: Diagnostic accuracy of different imaging modalities following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer.Authors: Tamburrino D, Riviere D, Yaghoobi M, Davidson BR, Gurusamy KSSource: Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Sep 15;9:CD011515.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Periampullary cancer includes cancer of the head and neck of the pancreas, cancer of the distal end of the bile duct, cancer of the ampulla of Vater, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. Surgical resection is the only established potentially curative treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancer. A considerable proportion of patients undergo unnecessary laparotomy because of underestimation of the extent of the cancer on computed tomography (CT) scanning. Other imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), PET-CT, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been used to detect local invasion or distant metastases not visualised on CT scanning which could prevent unnecessary laparotomy. No systematic review or meta-analysis has examined the role of different imaging modalities in assessing the resectability with curative intent in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, PET scan, and EUS performed as an add-on test or PET-CT as a replacement test to CT scanning in detecting curative resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) databases up to 5 November 2015. Two review authors independently screened the references and selected the studies for inclusion. We also searched for articles related to the included studies by performing the "related search" function in MEDLINE (OvidSP) and Embase (OvidSP) and a "citing reference" search (by searching the articles that cite the included articles). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic accuracy studies of MRI, PET scan, PET-CT, and EUS in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer on CT scan. We accepted any criteria of resectability used in the studies. We included studies irrespective of language, publication status, or study design (prospective or retrospective). We excluded case-control studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed data extraction and quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies - 2) tool. Although we planned to use bivariate methods for analysis of sensitivities and specificities, we were able to fit only the univariate fixed-effect models for both sensitivity and specificity because of the paucity of data. We calculated the probability of unresectability in patients who had a positive index test (post-test probability of unresectability in people with a positive test result) and in those with negative index test (post-test probability of unresectability in people with a positive test result) using the mean probability of unresectability (pre-test probability) from the included studies and the positive and negative likelihood ratios derived from the model. The difference between the pre-test and post-test probabilities gave the overall added value of the index test compared to the standard practice of CT scan staging alone. MAIN RESULTS: Only two studies (34 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Both studies evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of EUS in assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic cancers. There was low concerns about applicability for most domains in both studies. The overall risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the second study. The mean probability of unresectable disease after CT scan across studies was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after CT scan had unresectable disease on laparotomy). The summary estimate of sensitivity of EUS for unresectability was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.97) and the summary estimate of specificity for unresectability was 0.80 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.96). The positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 4.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 18.6) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.8) respectively. At the mean pre-test probability of 60.5%, the post-test probability of unresectable disease for people with a positive EUS (EUS indicating unresectability) was 86.9% (95% CI 60.9% to 96.6%) and the post-test probability of unresectable disease for people with a negative EUS (EUS indicating resectability) was 20.0% (5.1% to 53.7%). This means that 13% of people (95% CI 3% to 39%) with positive EUS have potentially resectable cancer and 20% (5% to 53%) of people with negative EUS have unresectable cancer. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on two small studies, there is significant uncertainty in the utility of EUS in people with pancreatic cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan. No studies have assessed the utility of EUS in people with periampullary cancer.There is no evidence to suggest that it should be performed routinely in people with pancreatic cancer or periampullary cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan.PMID: 27631318Title: The surgical outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy versus laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary neoplasms: a comparative study of a single center.Authors: Liu R, Zhang T, Zhao ZM, Tan XL, Zhao GD, Zhang X, Xu YSource: Surg Endosc. 2016 Sep 8.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a difficult and complex operation. The introduction of robotics has opened up new angles in pancreatic surgery. This study aims to assess the surgical outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy relative to its laparoscopic counterpart. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed to compare the surgical outcomes of 27 robot-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) and 25 laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). Perioperative data, including operating time, complication, morbidity and mortality, estimated blood loss, and postoperative length of stay, were analyzed. RESULTS: The robotic group exhibited significantly shorter operative time (mean 387 vs. 442 min), shorter hospital stay (mean 17 vs. 24 days), and less blood loss (mean 219 vs. 334 ml) than those in the LPD group. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups in terms of complication rate, mortality rate, R0 resection rate, and number of harvested lymph node. CONCLUSIONS: RPD is more efficient and secure process than LPD among properly selected patients. RPD is therefore a feasible alternative to the laparoscopic procedure. Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the robotic approach for PD.PMID: 27631212Title: A case report of motesanib-induced biliary sludge formation causing obstructive cholangitis with acute pancreatitis treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy.Authors: Song J, Kim SB, Kim KH, Kim TN, Lee KHSource: Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Sep;95(37):e4645. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004645.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gallbladder toxicity was reported in most motesanib studies with varying frequency and at variable times after initiation of treatment. METHOD AND RESULTS: A 44-year-old man was admitted due to severe epigastric pain. The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer 9 months ago and received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with motesanib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin. Ultrasonography showed a large amount of sludge within gallbladder. Computed tomography scan demonstrated diffuse dilatation of biliary tree with distended gallbladder without evidence of stone and mild pancreatic swelling. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed yellowish viscous mucoid plug impacting ampullary orifice and dilated bile duct with amorphous filling defect at distal half of common duct. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed to prevent biliary obstruction and recurrent pancreatitis after removal of mucoid material. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of obstructive cholangitis and acute pancreatitis associated with sludge formation during motesanib therapy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy appears to be useful to treat and prevent biliary obstruction caused by motesanib-induced biliary sludge.PMID: 27630665Title: Post-transcriptional Regulation of BRCA2 through Interactions with miR-19a and miR-19b.Authors: Mogilyansky E, Clark P, Quann K, Zhou H, Londin E, Jing Y, Rigoutsos ISource: Front Genet. 2016 Aug 31;7:143. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2016.00143. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Breast cancer type 2, early onset susceptibility gene (BRCA2) is a major component of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. It acts as a tumor suppressor whose function is often lost in cancers. Patients with specific mutations in the BRCA2 gene often display discrete clinical, histopathological, and molecular features. However, a subset of sporadic cancers has wild type BRCA2 and display defects in the homology-directed repair pathway, which is the hallmark of 'BRCAness.' The mechanisms by which BRCAness arises are not well understood but post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA2 gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to this phenotype. Here, we examine the post-transcriptional effects that some members of the six-miRNA cluster known as the miR-17/92 cluster have on the abundance of BRCA2's messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. We discuss two interactions involving the miR-19a and miR-19b members of the cluster and the 3'UTR of BRCA2's mRNA. We investigated these miRNA:mRNA interactions in 15 cell lines derived from pancreatic, breast, colon, and kidney tissue. We show that over-expression of these two miRNAs results in a concomitant decrease of BRCA2's mRNA and protein expression in a subset of the tested cell lines. Additionally, using luciferase reporter assays we identified direct interactions between miR-19a/miR-19b and a miRNA response element (MRE) in BRCA2's 3'UTR. Our results suggest that BRCA2 is subject to a complex post-transcriptional regulatory program that has specific dependencies on the genetic and phenotypic background of cell types.PMID: 27630308Title: Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Induces Apoptosis of Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells.Authors: Nishi K, Suzuki K, Sawamoto J, Tokizawa Y, Iwase Y, Yumita N, Ikeda TSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4655-60.Abstract: Cancer cells tend to have a high requirement for lipids, including fatty acids, cholesterol and triglyceride, because of their rapid proliferative rate compared to normal cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of inhibition of lipid synthesis on the proliferation and viability of human pancreatic cancer cells. Of the inhibitors of lipid synthesis that were tested, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), which is an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors cerulenin and irgasan, significantly suppressed the proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells. Treatment of MiaPaCa-2 cells with these inhibitors significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells. In addition, TOFA increased caspase-3 activity and induced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Moreover, addition of palmitate to MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with TOFA rescued cells from apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that TOFA induces apoptosis via depletion of fatty acids and that, among the various aspects of lipid metabolism, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis may be a notable target for the treatment of human pancreatic cancer cells.PMID: 27630293Title: MEK Inhibitor Suppresses Expression of the miR-17-92 Cluster with G1-Phase Arrest in HT-29 Human Colon Cancer Cells and MIA PaCa-2 Pancreatic Cancer Cells.Authors: Tanaka R, Tomosugi M, Sakai T, Sowa YSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4537-43.Abstract: BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, and the deregulated expression of miRNAs is associated with tumor development. Among these, the miR-17-92 cluster, including six mature miRNAs, is known as an oncogenic miRNA cluster because expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is frequently elevated in a variety of malignant tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated whether a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD0325901, suppresses expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in HT-29 human colon cancer cells and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. RESULTS: PD0325901 inhibited cell growth with G1-phase arrest and suppressed expression of the miR-17-92 cluster. Furthermore, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is a target molecule of the miR-17-92 cluster, was up-regulated by PD0325901. The exogenous expression of miR-17 slightly, but significantly reduced G1-phase arrest by PD0325901. CONCLUSION: These results raise the possibility that a MEK inhibitor causes G1-phase arrest, at least partially, through suppression of the miR-17-92 cluster.PMID: 27630273Title: Paradoxical Role of HMGB1 in Pancreatic Cancer: Tumor Suppressor or Tumor Promoter?Authors: Cebrian MJ, Bauden M, Andersson R, Holdenrieder S, Ansari DSource: Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4381-9.Abstract: Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and there is an increasing and unmet need to identify better diagnostic and therapeutic targets in order to ameliorate the course of the disease. HMGB1, a nuclear DNA-binding protein that acts as a transcription factor, is currently in the limelight. HMGB1 exhibits a dual role in pancreatic cancer; when intracellular, it acts as an anti-tumor protein stabilizing the genome, whereas extracellular HMGB1 behaves as a pro-tumor protein with cytokine, chemokine and growth factor functions. Although the exact mechanisms of HMGB1 in pancreatic cancer are still to be elucidated, the significance of this protein for processes, such as autophagy, immunogenic cell death, tumor growth, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy, have become increasingly clear. In this review, we provide a systematic summary and review of the biological and clinical relevance of HMGB1 in pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27630212Title: Pancreatic Safety of Sitagliptin in the TECOS Study.Authors: Buse JB, Bethel MA, Green JB, Stevens SR, Lokhnygina Y, Aschner P, Grado CR, Tankova T, Wainstein J, Josse R, Lachin JM, Engel SS, Patel K, Peterson ED, Holman RRSource: Diabetes Care. 2016 Sep 14. pii: dc152780.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the incidence of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease who were treated with sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), a cardiovascular safety study of sitagliptin, all suspected cases of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were collected prospectively for 14,671 participants during a median follow-up time of 3 years, and were adjudicated blindly. RESULTS: Baseline differences were minimal between participants confirmed to have no pancreatic events, acute pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer. Among those participants randomized to receive sitagliptin, 23 (0.3%) (vs. 12 randomized to receive placebo [0.2%]) had pancreatitis (hazard ratio 1.93 [95% CI 0.96-3.88], P = 0.065; 0.107 vs. 0.056/100 patient-years), with 25 versus 17 events, respectively. Severe pancreatitis (two fatal) occurred in four individuals allocated to receive sitagliptin. Cases of pancreatic cancer were numerically fewer with sitagliptin (9 [0.1%]) versus placebo (14 [0.2%]) (hazard ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.28-1.51], P = 0.32; 0.042 vs. 0.066 events/100 patient-years). Meta-analysis with two other DPP-4i cardiovascular outcome studies showed an increased risk for acute pancreatitis (risk ratio 1.78 [95% CI 1.13-2.81], P = 0.01) and no significant effect for pancreatic cancer (risk ratio 0.54 [95% CI 0.28-1.04], P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were uncommon events with rates that were not statistically significantly different between the sitagliptin and placebo groups, although pancreatitis developed in numerically more sitagliptin participants and pancreatic cancer developed in fewer sitagliptin participants. Meta-analysis suggests a small absolute increased risk for pancreatitis with DPP-4i therapy.PMID: 27629958Title: A Splenic Epithelial Cyst: Increased Size, Exacerbation of Symptoms, and Elevated Levels of Serum Carcinogenic Antigen 19-9 after 6-year Follow-up.Authors: Matsui T, Matsubayashi H, Sugiura T, Sasaki K, Ito H, Hotta K, Imai K, Tanaka M, Kakushima N, Ono HSource: Intern Med. 2016;55(18):2629-34. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.6970. Epub 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: A 58-year-old man, who had presented with a large cyst between the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum 6 years previously, was referred to our hospital with exacerbation of abdominal distention. Computed tomography revealed a well-demarcated, unilocular cyst, with a beak sign for the pancreas, without wall thickening or nodules suggestive of a non-neoplastic cyst. Compared with 6 years previously, the cyst had increased in size from 14.7 cm to 19.5 cm, and the serum carcinogenic antigen 19-9 level had increased from 635 U/mL to 1,918 U/mL. To prevent spontaneous rupture, laparotomy was performed, and the cyst was pathologically diagnosed as a splenic epithelial cyst.PMID: 27629944Title: Risk Factors for Post-Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Pancreatitis and Stent Dysfunction after Preoperative Biliary Drainage in Patients with Malignant Biliary Stricture.Authors: Hashimoto S, Ito K, Koshida S, Kanno Y, Ogawa T, Masu K, Iwashita Y, Horaguchi J, Kobayashi G, Noda YSource: Intern Med. 2016;55(18):2529-36. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.6832. Epub 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: Objective To retrospectively evaluate the risk factors for post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) and stent dysfunction after performing preoperative biliary drainage (BD) in patients with malignant biliary stricture. Methods Between January 2003 and February 2013, 105 consecutive patients who had undergone transpapillary BD before surgery were enrolled in this study. Procedure-related complications, stent dysfunction rates, and their respective risk factors were investigated. PEP was defined according to the consensus guidelines. Results Fifty-five patients had bile duct cancer, 31 had pancreatic cancer, 16 had ampullary cancer, and 3 had gallbladder cancer. Endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) and nasobiliary drainage (NBD) were performed in 84 patients and 21 patients, respectively. PEP occurred in 10% of the patients, with a significantly higher frequency in those with hilar/upper bile duct stricture (p=0.026) and a normal bilirubin level at admission (p=0.016). Of the 84 patients who underwent initial EBS, stent dysfunction occurred in 13%. The mean number of days from EBS to stent dysfunction was 14+/-12 days. A multivariate analysis revealed a male gender (p=0.048), a stent diameter </=8 Fr (p=0.036), and an ERCP procedure time >/=45 minutes (p=0.021) to be risk factors for stent dysfunction. No NBD tube dysfunction was observed. Conclusion Patients with upper/hilar bile duct stricture or a normal bilirubin level are at high risk of developing PEP after preoperative BD. NBD or EBS with a large-bore stent is therefore recommended as preoperative BD.PMID: 27629876Title: Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: a rare disease with different diagnostic and therapeutic implications than ductal adenocarcinoma.Authors: Kruger S, Haas M, Burger PJ, Ormanns S, Modest DP, Westphalen CB, Kleespies A, Angele MK, Hartwig W, Bruns CJ, Kirchner T, Werner J, Heinemann V, Boeck SSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: PURPOSE: Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas is a very rare cancer, constituting 1 % of all malignant non-endocrine pancreatic tumors. Only very limited data exist to guide treatment in patients with advanced ACC. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2015, 15 patients with ACC were diagnosed and/or treated at our high-volume comprehensive cancer center. Medical records and correlating serum levels of the potential serum tumor markers CA 19-9, CEA and lipase were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A substantial antitumor activity was observed for treatment regimens containing 5-FU and oxaliplatin with partial responses or prolonged disease stabilizations (>12 months) observed in 6 out of 7 patients (86 %). Activity was also observed for single-agent 5-FU and its oral prodrugs. Serum lipase levels were elevated in 7 of 12 patients with advanced disease (58 %), whereas CEA and CA 19-9 seemed to be of minor importance for ACC (elevated pre-treatment levels in 4/12 and 3/12 cases, respectively). In selected patients, repeated serum lipase measurements were available and accurately predicted response to chemotherapy and relapse after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU- and oxaliplatin-containing regimens are active in advanced ACC. Lipase kinetics may be a useful novel tool to monitor the course of disease as well as treatment effects in ACC.PMID: 27629874Title: Factors associated with cancer worries in individuals participating in annual pancreatic cancer surveillance.Authors: Konings IC, Harinck F, Kuenen MA, Sidharta GN, Kieffer JM, Aalfs CM, Poley JW, Smets EM, Wagner A, van Rens A, Vleggaar FP, Ausems MG, Fockens P, van Hooft JE, Bruno MJ, Bleiker EMSource: Fam Cancer. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: It is important to adequately and timely identify individuals with cancer worries amongst participants in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) surveillance program, because they could benefit from psychosocial support to decrease distress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess both psychosocial and clinical factors associated with cancer worries. High-risk individuals participating in PDAC-surveillance were invited to annually complete a cancer worry scale (CWS) questionnaire which was sent after counseling by the clinical geneticist (T0), after intake for participation in PDAC-surveillance (T1), and then annually after every MRI and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (T2 and further). Analyses were performed to identify factors associated with cancer worries in the second year of surveillance (T3). We found a significant intra-individual decrease in cancer worries (beta = -0.84, P < 0.001), nevertheless, 33 % of individuals had a CWS-score >/=14 at T3. We found one factor significantly associated with cancer worries at T3: having a family member affected by PDAC <50 years of age (beta = 0.22, P = 0.03). The detection of a cystic lesion, a shortened surveillance interval, or undergoing pancreatic surgery did not lead to more cancer worries (P = 0.163, P = 0.33, and P = 0.53, respectively). In conclusion, this study identified 'a family history of PDAC <50 years of age' as the only predictor of cancer worries experienced after 2 years of surveillance in individuals at high risk of developing PDAC. This knowledge could help clinicians to timely identify individuals 'at risk' for high levels of cancer worries who would likely benefit from psychosocial support.PMID: 27629742Title: Axl Is a Potential Cancer Prognostic Marker for the Migration and Invasion of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.Authors: Jiang C, Zhou L, Wang H, Zhang Q, Xu YSource: Adv Clin Exp Med. 2016 May-Jun;25(3):531-7. doi: 10.17219/acem/38943.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase has been demonstrated to be elevated and activated in many human cancers including liver, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer. Its high expression has been considered as a cancer biomarker for predicting poor prognosis and increased invasiveness/metastasis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical significance of Axl in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and its role in cell migration and invasion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We detected Axl expression in 86 collected NPC tissues and 20 collected normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. Axl was knocked down by a specific shRNA in NPC cell lines, 5-8F and 6-10B. Transwell assays were used to determine NPC cell migration and invasion. RESULTS: The expressions of Axl mRNA and protein in NPC tissues were significantly higher than those in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues (p < 0.05, respectively). The positive expression of Axl was significantly correlated with distant metastasis and high TNM stage in NPC (p < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, Axl positive expression was correlated with a worse overall survival of NPC patients (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox repression analysis indicated that Axl was an independent factor for predicting overall survival of NPC patients (p < 0.05). In vitro studies found that Axl knockdown significantly reduced the number of migrated and invaded 5-8F and 6-10B cells (p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The positive expression of Axl is correlated with the poor clinicopathological features in NPC. Furthermore, Axl is an independent prognostic marker for predicting overall survival of NPC patients. Functionally, Axl may facilitate tumour progression by promoting NPC cell migration and invasion.PMID: 27629483Title: Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.Authors: di Sebastiano P, Grottola T, di Mola FFSource: Updates Surg. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is now recognized as a distinct clinical entity. In these cases, neoadjuvant treatment could maximize the potential for an R0 resection and avoid R1/R2 resections. In fact, by analyzing, the current literature is evident that approximately one-third of initially borderline resectable pancreatic tumors may undergo successful resection following neoadjuvant therapy. However, the enormous difficulties in achieving a consensus and the variability in therapeutic algorithms have delayed progress in establishing strong evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. In addition, the absence of a unique definition of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer remains a great obstacle for planning a therapeutic strategy and surgical decision-making. If on the one hand, we can finally say that the presence of only few prospective trials generates no strong data to support a specific neoadjuvant therapy regimen in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, there are many studies on patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy that can enjoy an R0 resection with similar outcomes to up-front resectable disease.PMID: 27629072Title: Roles of the first-generation claudin binder, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, in the diagnosis and claudin-targeted treatment of epithelium-derived cancers.Authors: Hashimoto Y, Yagi K, Kondoh MSource: Pflugers Arch. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: Given that most malignant tumors are derived from epithelium, developing a strategy for treatment of epithelium-derived cancers (i.e., carcinomas) is a pivotal issue in cancer therapy. Carcinomas, including ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, are known to overexpress various claudins (CLDNs); in particular, CLDN-3 and -4 are frequently overexpressed in malignant case. The generation of CLDN binders is a key for expanding CLDN-targeted cancer therapy but has been delayed due to the small size of CLDN extracellular domains (approximately 50 amino acids for the first domain and 15 amino acids for the second) and their high homology among species. Interestingly, however, the receptors for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), a foodborne toxin in humans, happen to be identical to CLDN-3 and -4. Thus, the first CLDN binder, CPE, has provided us CLDN-targeted cancer therapy from a concept into a potential reality. In this review, we describe roles of CPE technology in cancer therapy and discuss future directions in the CLDN-targeting concept-to-therapy process.PMID: 27628540Title: Analysis of long non-coding RNA expression profiles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Authors: Fu XL, Liu DJ, Yan TT, Yang JY, Yang MW, Li J, Huo YM, Liu W, Zhang JF, Hong J, Hua R, Chen HY, Sun YWSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 15;6:33535. doi: 10.1038/srep33535.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of non-protein-coding transcripts that have been implicated in cancer biogenesis and prognosis. By repurposing microarray probes, we herein analysed the lncRNA expression profiles in two public PDAC microarray datasets and identified 34 dysregulated lncRNAs in PDAC. In addition, the expression of 6 selected lncRNAs was confirmed in Ren Ji cohort and pancreatic cell lines, and their association with 80 PDAC patients' clinicopathological features and prognosis was investigated. Results indicated that AFAP1-AS1, UCA1 and ENSG00000218510 might be involved in PDAC progression and significantly associated with overall survival of PDAC. UCA1 and ENSG00000218510 expression status may serve as independent prognostic biomarkers for overall survival of PDAC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis suggested that high AFAP1-AS1, UCA1 and low ENSG00000218510 expression were correlated with several tumorigenesis related pathways. Functional experiments demonstrated that AFAP1-AS1 and UCA1 were required for efficient invasion and/or proliferation promotion in PDAC cell lines, while ENSG00000218510 acted the opposite. Our findings provide novel information on lncRNAs expression profiles which might be beneficial to the precise diagnosis, subcategorization and ultimately, the individualized therapy of PDAC.PMID: 27628423Title: Metastatic progression is associated with dynamic changes in the local microenvironment.Authors: Aiello NM, Bajor DL, Norgard RJ, Sahmoud A, Bhagwat N, Pham MN, Cornish TC, Iacobuzio-Donahue CA, Vonderheide RH, Stanger BZSource: Nat Commun. 2016 Sep 15;7:12819. doi: 10.1038/ncomms12819.Abstract: Most cancer-associated deaths result from metastasis. However, it remains unknown whether the size, microenvironment or other features of a metastatic lesion dictate its behaviour or determine the efficacy of chemotherapy in the adjuvant (micrometastatic) setting. Here we delineate the natural history of metastasis in an autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), using lineage tracing to examine the evolution of disseminated cancer cells and their associated microenvironment. With increasing size, lesions shift from mesenchymal to epithelial histology, become hypovascular and accumulate a desmoplastic stroma, ultimately recapitulating the primary tumours from which they arose. Moreover, treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel significantly reduces the overall number of metastases by inducing cell death in lesions of all sizes, challenging the paradigm that PDAC stroma imposes a critical barrier to drug delivery. These results illuminate the cellular dynamics of metastatic progression and suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy affords a survival benefit by directly targeting micrometastases.PMID: 27628324Title: mASH1 is Highly Specific for Neuroendocrine Carcinomas: An Immunohistochemical Evaluation on Normal and Various Neoplastic Tissues.Authors: Altree-Tacha D, Tyrrell J, Li FSource: Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: Context .- High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas and carcinoids can arise in different sites such as lung, gastrointestinal tract, prostate, and skin. Classic neuroendocrine markers such as CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin cannot distinguish carcinoids from high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Recently, mouse monoclonal mASH1 has been shown to help discriminate carcinoids from high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas in various neoplastic sites. To date, there have been no comprehensive immunohistochemistry studies with mASH1 on nonneuroendocrine neoplasms. Objective .- To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of mASH1 in various normal and neoplastic tissues, including lung cancers. Design .- Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays consisting of normal tissues and various neoplastic tissues were immunohistochemically evaluated with mASH1. Results .- In normal tissues (n = 30), mASH1 (nuclear staining) was sparsely expressed in the molecular cell layer, white matter, and granular cell layer of cerebellum; C cells in thyroid; and epithelial cells in thymus. In lung cancers, mASH1 stained 1.1% (1 of 93) of adenocarcinomas, 0.9% (1 of 111) of squamous cell carcinoma, 0% (0 of 30) of large cell carcinomas, 66.7% (6 of 9) of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and 82.5% (94 of 114) of small cell carcinoma. In other various other neoplastic tissues (n = 1114), mASH1 was expressed in thyroid medullary carcinomas, thymic carcinomas, and brain cancers; mASH1 was also expressed in a very low percentage of breast carcinomas, ovarian cancers, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. All typical carcinoids of various sites were negative (0 of 11), however, in lung atypical carcinoids, mASH1 was expressed in 42.9% (9 of 21). Conclusion .- Although not organ specific, mASH1 is highly specific for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas versus carcinoids and other nonneuroendocrine neoplasms.PMID: 27627810Title: Generation of an in vitro 3D PDAC stroma rich spheroid model.Authors: Ware MJ, Keshishian V, Law JJ, Ho JC, Favela CA, Rees P, Smith B, Mohammad S, Hwang RF, Rajapakshe K, Coarfa C, Huang S, Edwards DP, Corr SJ, Godin B, Curley SASource: Biomaterials. 2016 Sep 2;108:129-142. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.08.041.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a prominent desmoplastic/stromal reaction, which contributes to the poor clinical outcome of this disease. Therefore, greater understanding of the stroma development and tumor-stroma interactions is highly required. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are myofibroblast-like cells located in exocrine areas of the pancreas, which as a result of inflammation produced by PDAC migrate and accumulate in the tumor mass, secreting extracellular matrix components and producing the dense PDAC stroma. Currently, only a few orthotopic or ectopic animal tumor models, where PDAC cells are injected into the pancreas or subcutaneous tissue layer, or genetically engineered animals offer tumors that encompass some stromal component. Herein, we report generation of a simple 3D PDAC in vitro micro-tumor model without an addition of external extracellular matrix, which encompasses a rich, dense and active stromal compartment. We have achieved this in vitro model by incorporating PSCs into 3D PDAC cell culture using a modified hanging drop method. It is now known that PSCs are the principal source of fibrosis in the stroma and interact closely with cancer cells to create a tumor facilitatory environment that stimulates local and distant tumor growth. The 3D micro-stroma models are highly reproducible with excellent uniformity, which can be used for PDAC-stroma interaction analysis and high throughput automated drug-screening assays. Additionally, the increased expression of collagenous regions means that molecular based perfusion and cytostaticity of gemcitabine is decreased in our Pancreatic adenocarcinoma stroma spheroids (PDAC-SS) model when compared to spheroids grown without PSCs. We believe this model will allow an improved knowledge of PDAC biology and has the potential to provide an insight into pathways that may be therapeutically targeted to inhibit PSC activation, thereby inhibiting the development of fibrosis in PDAC and interrupting PSC-PDAC cell interactions so as to inhibit cancer progression.PMID: 27627636Title: The role of endoscopic ultrasound in the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a systematic update.Authors: Smith LA, McKay CJSource: Minerva Med. 2016 Sep 14.Abstract: The widespread use of cross-sectional imaging has lead to an increased frequency of incidentally detected pancreatic cysts. Neoplastic cysts such as mucinous lesions and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms have malignant potential and therefore the early detection of these lesions presents an opportunity for prevention or early detection and management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Serous neoplastic lesions and non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts such as pseudocysts or walled off pancreatic necrosis and are not associated with malignant potential. It is important to identify those mucinous lesions with the highest potential of malignancy in order to direct management either towards surveillance or resection. The preoperative diagnosis of these cysts is a challenge as cross-sectional imaging alone is often inadequate at making the diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with or without fine needle aspiration (FNA) can assess the morphology of cysts including identification of high risk characteristics of cysts as well as allowing aspiration of cyst fluid, which can be analysed for cytology, mucin, tumour markers, amylase and molecular markers. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) have three main subtypes; main duct IPMNs (MD-IPMN), branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMN) and mixed type IPMNs which have feature of both the aforementioned. MD-IPMNs have the highest malignant potential and are often easier to identify on cross-sectional imaging due to the involvement of the main pancreatic duct. Current guidelines suggest that these lesions should generally be considered for resection without further evaluation. Several guidelines exist for the investigation and management of BD-IPMNs, which have a lower malignant potential and there has been much interest in more clearly defining the role of EUS and EUS-FNA in this group of patients. In this review article we discuss the role of EUS in the diagnosis, risk stratification and management of these lesions.PMID: 27627078Title: [Hypoglycemia as a symptom of cancer in adults].Authors: Frysak Z, Karasek DSource: Vnitr Lek. 2016 Fall;62(7-8):564-7.Abstract: Decrease of blood glucose levels below 3 mmol/l is in fully developed cases accompanied by neuroglycopenic symptoms that may even lead to altered state of consciousness. The treating physician frequently faces a complicated situation. This may be due to inappropriately administered drugs including cases motivated by self-harm intentions (insulin, insulin secretagogues), or alcohol abuse. Undernourished people, or those afflicted with a serious systemic infection, end-stage liver or kidney diseases or with a failing heart, belong to a risk group. Hypoglycemia typically accompanies hypocorticism (Addisons disease) or lack of glucagon. Endogenous hyperinsulinism caused by a hormonally active pancreatic cancer, that is, by a neuroendocrine tumour - insulinoma, is a possibility to be considered. A hidden cause of hypoglycemias may be a pancreatic-beta- cell dysfunction (nesidioblastosis, or non-insulin pancreatogenous hypoglycemia). A similar situation may arise following gastric bypass surgery. Hypoglycemia incited by the presence of antibodies to insulin or its receptor is cited in literature as a very rare problem. One section in the differentially diagnostic thinking is dedicated to hypoglycemic states accompanying neoplastic, malign processes. Insulin is demonstrably not a responsible agent here, it is a polypeptide structurally close to it, a somatomedin abbreviated as IGF2.

In an effort to develop novel therapeutic strategies, we found downregulation of miR-29 in pancreatic cancer cells, and overexpression of miR-29a sensitized chemotherapeutic resistant pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, reduced cancer cell viability, and increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, miR-29a blocked autophagy flux, as evidenced by an accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagy markers, LC3B and p62, and a decrease in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In addition, miR-29a decreased the expression of autophagy proteins, TFEB and ATG9A, which are critical for lysosomal function and autophagosome trafficking respectively. Knockdown of TFEB or ATG9A inhibited autophagy similar to miR-29a overexpression. Finally, miR-29a reduced cancer cell migration, invasion, and anchorage independent growth. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-29a functions as a potent autophagy inhibitor, sensitizes cancer cells to gemcitabine, and decreases their invasive potential. Our data provides evidence for the use of miR-29a as a novel therapeutic agent to target PDAC.PMID: 27626490Title: Altered expression of CD226 and CD96 on natural killer cells in patients with pancreatic cancer.Authors: Peng YP, Xi CH, Zhu Y, Yin LD, Wei JS, Zhang JJ, Liu XC, Guo S, Fu Y, Miao YSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 10. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11953.Abstract: The progression of pancreatic cancer (PC) is significantly associated with tumor immune escape, which may be associated with nature killer (NK) cell dysfunction. CD226, CD96, and TIGIT, which share the ligand CD155, play important roles in the regulation of NK cell function. The present study was conducted to investigate the roles of these molecules in NK cells from PC patients. Expression of these molecules on NK cells was detected from samples of 92 pancreatic cancer patients and 40 healthy controls. The expression of CD155 was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 88 pancreatic cancer tissues. The percentage of CD226+ and CD96+ NK cells was significantly lower in PC patients than in the healthy controls; however, the mean fluorescence intensity of CD226 and CD96 was not significantly different between the two groups. TIGIT expression on NK cells from PC patients was similar to that in the healthy controls. Additionally, the expression of CD226 was positively correlated with CD96. Further analysis demonstrated that the decrease in the percentage of CD226+ and CD96+ NK cells was associated with tumor histological grade and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, the CD155 levels in PC tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues. Our results suggest that a lower percentage of CD226+ and CD96+ NK cells may contribute to tumor immune escape in PC patients; moreover, the use of NK cells with high CD226 and CD96 expression to treat PC cells with high CD155 expression may have potential and should be explored in the future.PMID: 27626310Title: ISG15 in the tumorigenesis and treatment of cancer: An emerging role in malignancies of the digestive system.Authors: Zuo C, Sheng X, Ma M, Xia M, Ouyang LSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 8. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11911.Abstract: The interferon-stimulated gene 15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) encodes an IFN-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein. The ISG15 protein forms conjugates with numerous cellular proteins that are involved in a multitude of cellular functions, including interferon-induced immune responses and the regulation of cellular protein turnover. The expression of ISG15 and ISG15-mediated conjugation has been implicated in a wide range of human tumors and cancer cell lines, but the roles of ISG15 in tumorigenesis and responses to anticancer treatments remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the findings of recent studies with regard to the role of ISG15 pathways in cancers of the digestive system.PMID: 27626307Title: A panel of 13-miRNA signature as a potential biomarker for predicting survival in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Zhou X, Huang Z, Xu L, Zhu M, Zhang L, Zhang H, Wang X, Li H, Zhu W, Shu Y, Liu PSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 8. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11903.Abstract: Some reports have evaluated the prognostic relevance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). However, most studies focused on limited miRNAs with small number of patients. The aim of the study is to identify a panel of miRNA signature that could predict prognosis in PC with the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 167 PC patients with the corresponding clinical data were enrolled in our study. The miRNAs significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in PC patients were identified with Cox proportional regression model. A risk score formula was developed to evaluate the prognostic value of the miRNA signature in PC. Thirteen miRNAs were identified to be significantly related with OS in PC patients. Patients with high risk score suffered poor overall survival compared with patients who had low risk score. The multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the miRNA signature could act as an independent prognostic indicator. In addition, the signature might serve as a predicator for treatment outcome. Our study identified a miRNA signature including 13 miRNAs which could serve as an independent marker in prognosis of PC.PMID: 27625194Title: Pancreatic cancer: gammadelta T cells support PDAC.Authors: Dickson ISource: Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2016 Sep 14. doi: 10.1038/nrgastro.2016.156.Abstract: ?PMID: 27624947Title: Using Experience-Based Design to Improve the Care Experience for Patients With Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Hagensen A, London AE, Phillips JJ, Helton WS, Picozzi VJ, Blackmore CCSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep 13. pii: JOPR011213.Abstract: PURPOSE: Despite the importance of the patient care experience to quality and outcome, the literature detailing the care experience in patients with pancreatic cancer is limited. METHODS: To elicit the experience of patients with pancreatic cancer for care redesign, we deployed experience-based design, an emerging methodology based on identification of events of high emotional content, known as touch points, to delineate qualitatively what matters most to patients and families. We defined touch points through direct observations, interviews, and a focus group. We then used experience questionnaires to measure emotional content and develop an experience map to graphically display the fluctuating emotional journey through the care processes. Study subjects were patients with pancreatic cancer who were cared for at Virginia Mason Medical Center, family caregivers, and staff. Redesign was initiated through an all-day improvement event in September 2013. RESULTS: During 2013 and 2014, we cared for 485 new patients with pancreatic cancer, the majority of whom had local disease at diagnosis. The response rate for the experience questionnaire was 23% (117 of 500 questionnaires distributed). The experience-based design results were often contrary to staff preconceptions of the care experience for patients with pancreatic cancer, and contributed to redesign in three key areas: understanding and documenting patient goals and values, providing better resources for caregivers/families, and improving care coordination and support services. CONCLUSION: Experience-based design enabled us to understand the care experience and associated emotional content for patients with pancreatic cancer and their caregivers. This knowledge then supported care redesign targeted at areas of high negative emotional content.PMID: 27624879Title: alpha-Mangostin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles inhibit pancreatic carcinogenesis by targeting cancer stem cells in human, and transgenic (Kras(G12D), and Kras(G12D)/tp53R270H) mice.Authors: Verma RK, Yu W, Shrivastava A, Shankar S, Srivastava RKSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 14;6:32743. doi: 10.1038/srep32743.Abstract: Activation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) in cancer stem cell (CSC) has been demonstrated with aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer. In order to enhance the biological activity of alpha-mangostin, we formulated mangostin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (Mang-NPs) and examined the molecular mechanisms by which they inhibit human and KC mice (Pdx(Cre);LSL-Kras(G12D)) pancreatic CSC characteristics in vitro, and pancreatic carcinogenesis in KPC (Pdx(Cre);LSLKras(G12D);LSL-Trp53(R172H)) mice. Mang-NPs inhibited human and Kras(G12D) mice pancreatic CSC characteristics in vitro. Mang-NPs also inhibited EMT by up-regulating E-cadherin and inhibiting N-cadherin and transcription factors Slug, and pluripotency maintaining factors Nanog, c-Myc, and Oct4. Furthermore, Mang-NPs inhibited the components of Shh pathway and Gli targets. In vivo, Mang-NPs inhibited the progression of pancreatic intraneoplasia to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis in KPC mice. The inhibitory effects of Mang-NPs on carcinogenesis in KPC mice were associated with downregulation of pluripotency maintaining factors (c-Myc, Nanog and Oct4), stem cell markers (CD24 and CD133), components of Shh pathway (Gli1, Gli2, Patched1/2, and Smoothened), Gli targets (Bcl-2, XIAP and Cyclin D1), and EMT markers and transcription factors (N-cadherin, Slug, Snail and Zeb1), and upregulation of E-cadherin. Overall, our data suggest that Mang-NPs can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth, development and metastasis by targeting Shh pathway.PMID: 27624777Title: Inhibition of S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferase Attenuates TGF-beta1-induced EMT and Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer: Putative Roles of miR-663a and miR-4787-5p.Authors: Mody H, Hung SW, Al-Saggar M, Griffin J, Govindarajan RSource: Mol Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 13. pii: molcanres.0083.2016.Abstract: Identification of epigenetic reversal agents for use in combination chemotherapies to treat human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) remains an unmet clinical need. Pharmacological inhibitors of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) are emerging as potential histone methylation reversal agents for the treatment of various solid tumors and leukemia; however, the surprisingly small set of mRNA targets identified with EZH2 knockdown suggests novel mechanisms contribute to their anti-tumorigenic effects. Here, 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase and EZH2 histone lysine-Nmethyltransferase, significantly reprograms noncoding miRNA (miR) expression and dampens TGFbeta1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) signals in pancreatic cancer. In particular, miR-663a and miR-4787-5p were identified as PDAC-downregulated miRs that were reactivated by DZNep to directly target TGFbeta1 for RNA interference. Lentiviral overexpression of miR-663a and miR-4787-5p reduced TGFbeta1 synthesis and secretion in PDAC cells and partially phenocopied DZNep's EMT-resisting effects, whereas locked nucleic acid (LNA) antagomiRs counteracted them. DZNep, miR-663a, and miR-4787-5p reduced tumor burden in vivo and metastases in an orthotopic mouse pancreatic tumor model. Taken together, these findings suggest the epigenetic reprogramming of miRs by synthetic histone methylation reversal agents as a viable approach to attenuate TGFbeta1-induced EMT features in human PDAC and uncover putative miR targets involved in the process. IMPLICATIONS: The findings support the potential for synthetic histone methylation reversal agents to be included in future epigenetic-chemotherapeutic combination therapies for pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27624498Title: Short-term efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization with epirubicin-loaded superabsorbent polymer microspheres for hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison with conventional transarterial chemoembolization.Authors: Morimoto M, Kobayashi S, Moriya S, Ueno M, Tezuka S, Irie K, Goda Y, Ohkawa SSource: Abdom Radiol (NY). 2016 Sep 13.Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the short-term efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with epirubicin-loaded superabsorbent polymer embolics (SAP) and conventional TACE in TACE-naive patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients (mean age, 72.8 years; hepatitis C, 46%; BCLC-A or B, 52% or 48%) treated with TACE with SAP during 2013-2015 and 55 consecutive patients (mean age, 71.8 years; hepatitis C, 40%; BCLC-A or B, 51% or 49%) treated with conventional TACE during 2011-2013 were evaluated. Safety evaluations were based on CTCAE ver. 4.0. Short-term efficacies, i.e., at 1 month after TACE, were assessed using the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Short-term response markers were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of any grade of adverse events. The objective response rates were 50% and 62% in patients treated with TACE with SAP and with conventional TACE, respectively (P = 0.358). The overall survival rates were not significantly different (P = 0.810); the 1-year survival rates and the median survival time of the patients treated with TACE with SAP and with conventional TACE were 76% and 74%, and 18 months and 21 months, respectively. Overall survival was related to the short-term response. An alpha-fetoprotein level <1,000 ng/mL was a significant short-term response marker on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: For TACE-naive patients, TACE with SAP and conventional TACE had comparable safety and short-term efficacies.PMID: 27624137Title: Analysis of Base-Position Error Rate of Next-Generation Sequencing to Detect Tumor Mutations in Circulating DNA.Authors: Pecuchet N, Rozenholc Y, Zonta E, Pietraz D, Didelot A, Combe P, Gibault L, Bachet JB, Taly V, Fabre E, Blons H, Laurent-Puig PSource: Clin Chem. 2016 Sep 13. pii: clinchem.2016.258236.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Detecting single-nucleotide variations and insertions/deletions in circulating tumor DNA is challenging because of their low allele frequency. The clinical use of circulating tumor DNA to characterize tumor genetic alterations requires new methods based on next-generation sequencing. METHODS: We developed a method based on quantification of error rate of each base position [position error rate (PER)]. To identify mutations, a binomial test was used to compare the minor-allele frequency to the measured PER at each base position. This process was validated in control samples and in 373 plasma samples from patients with lung or pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Minimal mutated allele frequencies were 0.003 for single-nucleotide variations and 0.001 for insertions/deletions. Independent testing performed by droplet digital PCR (n = 231 plasma samples) showed strong agreement with the base-PER method (kappa = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted next-generation sequencing analyzed with the base-PER method represents a robust and low cost method to detect circulating tumor DNA in patients with cancer.PMID: 27623938Title: Association between selenium intake and the risk of pancreatic cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.Authors: Wang L, Wang J, Liu X, Liu Q, Zhang G, Liang LSource: Biosci Rep. 2016 Sep 13. pii: BSR20160345.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Quantification of the association between the intake of selenium and risk of pancreatic cancer is still conflicting. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence from epidemiological studies of selenium intake with the risk of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Pertinent studies were identified by a search of PubMed and Web of Knowledge to July 2016. The random effect model was used. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were conducted. RESULTS: Data from 6 studies including 1,424 pancreatic cancer cases were used in this meta-analysis. Pooled results suggested that highest selenium intake amount versus lowest amount was significantly associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer [summary relative risk (RR) =0.659, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.489-0.889, I2 = 47.6%]. The associations were significant both in case-control studies [RR =0.618, 95%CI =0.399-0.956, I2 = 59.1%] and Americas [RR =0.570, 95%CI =0.357-0.909, I2 = 65.6%]. No publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that the higher intake of selenium might reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27623560Title: Feasibility of Immunohistochemistry on Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine-Needle Aspiration Samples for Evaluating Predictive Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer Management.Authors: Puleo F, Demetter P, Eisendrath P, Marechal R, Verset L, Toussaint E, Bachet JB, Arvanitakis M, Mostafa I, Deviere J, Van Laethem JLSource: Pancreas. 2016 Oct;45(9):e50-2. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000672.Abstract: ?PMID: 27623556Title: Identification of Novel Serum Autoantibodies for Differential Diagnosis of Autoimmune Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.Authors: Felix K, Hauck O, Schnolzer M, Kempf T, Warnken U, Schneider K, Bergmann F, Fritz S, Werner JSource: Pancreas. 2016 Oct;45(9):1309-19. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000647.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The lack of specific biochemical markers is a major drawback for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). The aims were to characterize the autoantibody profiles in AIP and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to identify circulating autoantibodies that could be diagnostic markers differentiating PDAC and the AIP subtypes. METHODS: Tissue lysates obtained from the resected pancreas of patients with AIP and patients with PDAC were separated by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis subsequently immunoblotted with autologous sera. The immunoreactive spots were subjected to nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to identify serum autoantibodies to tissue-derived autoantigens associated with AIP and PDAC. Autoantibody concentrations for selected autoantigens were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: A total of 115 immunoreactive spots were identified by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunobloting. Nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis revealed 68 autoantigens in AIP, 26 in PDAC, and 21 present in both diseases. Assessment of 13 selected AIP autoantibody serum levels revealed that 7 of them had significantly higher titers in AIP versus PDAC. IgG-directed against transaldolase could significantly differentiate between the 2 AIP subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The novel panel of AIP autoantibodies is promising to supplement the predictive tests for AIP of the currently known autoantigens and represent a basis for a combined blood test to differentiate AIP from PDAC in the future.PMID: 27623078Title: Unique metabolic features of pancreatic cancer stroma: relevance to the tumor compartment, prognosis, and invasive potential.Authors: Knudsen ES, Balaji U, Freinkman E, McCue P, Witkiewicz AKSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 7. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11893.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. The aggressiveness and therapeutic recalcitrance of this malignancy has been attributed to multiple factors including the influence of an active desmoplastic stroma. How the stromal microenvironment of PDAC contributes to the fatal nature of this disease is not well defined. In the analysis of clinical specimens, we observed diverse expression of the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase IX and the lactate transporter MCT4 in the stromal compartment. These stromal features were associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype in PDAC tumor cells, and with shorter patient survival. Cultured cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from primary PDAC exhibited a high basal level of hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1alpha) that was both required and sufficient to modulate the expression of MCT4. This event was associated with increased transcription and protein synthesis of HIF1alpha in CAFs relative to PDAC cell lines, while surprisingly the protein turnover rate was equivalent. CAFs utilized glucose predominantly for glycolytic intermediates, whereas glutamine was the preferred metabolite for the TCA cycle. Unlike PDAC cell lines, CAFs were resistant to glucose withdrawal but sensitive to glutamine depletion. Consistent with the lack of reliance on glucose, CAFs could survive the acute depletion of MCT4. In co-culture and xenograft studies CAFs stimulated the invasive potential and metastatic spread of PDAC cell lines through a mechanism dependent on HIF1alpha and MCT4. Together, these data indicate that stromal metabolic features influence PDAC tumor cells to promote invasiveness and metastatic potential and associate with poor outcome in patients with PDAC.PMID: 27622478Title: Necrolytic migratory erythema and pancreatic glucagonoma.Authors: Rodriguez G, Vargas E, Abaunza C, Caceres SSource: Biomedica. 2016 Jun 3;36(2):176-81. doi: 10.7705/biomedica.v36i3.2723.Abstract: Necrolytic migratory erythema is a rare paraneoplastic dermatosis that may be the first clinical manifestation of the glucagonoma syndrome, a disorder characterized by mucocutaneous rash, glucose intolerance, hypoaminoacidemia, hyperglucagonaemia and pancreatic glucagonoma. The clinical case of a 45-year-old woman is presented. She had been experiencing weight loss, polydipsia, polyphagia, postprandial emesis, excessive hair loss and abdominal pain for two months. Erythematous, scaly and migratory plaques with 20 days of evolution were found on her trunk, perineum, elbows, hands, feet, inframammary and antecubital folds. The skin biopsy revealed noticeable vacuolar changes in high epidermal cells, extensive necrosis and thin orthokeratotic cornified layer. These findings pointed to a diagnosis of necrolytic migratory erythema. A suggestion was made to investigate a pancreatic glucagonoma. Laboratory tests showed moderate anemia, hyperglycemia and marked hyperglucagonaemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring 6 x 5 x 5 cm which was resected. The histopathological findings were compatible with a diagnosis of glucagonoma, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Skin symptoms disappeared 10 days after the tumor resection. We can conclude that the histological changes defined may be clues that can lead the search for a distant skin disease and allow for its diagnosis. The histological pattern of vacuolation and epidermal necrosis should arouse suspicion of pancreatic glucagonoma.PMID: 27622341Title: Increased Expression of HYAL1 in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.Authors: Kohi S, Sato N, Cheng XB, Koga A, Hirata KSource: Pancreas. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Increased production and processing (degradation) of hyaluronan (HA) is critical for cancer invasion and metastasis. Although HA is known to be overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), little is known about the expression and biological significance of HA-degrading enzymes, hyaluronidases (HYALs), in PDAC. METHODS: Expression of HYALs mRNA was examined in PDAC cells by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. HYAL1 protein expression was examined in primary PDAC tumors by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. The migratory ability of PDAC cells was determined by a transwell cell migration assay. RESULTS: Screening of mRNA expression of three major HYAL genes (HYAL1, 2, and 3) identified HYAL1 as a gene overexpressed in PDAC cells. Treatment of PDAC cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A further increased the HYAL1 expression, suggesting a possible involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. HYAL1 protein concentrations were significantly higher in primary PDAC tissues as compared with nontumor pancreatic tissues (P = 0.049). Importantly, inhibition of HYAL activity by dextran sulfate significantly inhibited the migration of PDAC cells showing strong HYAL1 expression (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that overexpression of HYAL1 is a common mechanism that may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of PDAC.PMID: 27622194Title: Autoimmune Pancreatitis and IgG4 Related Disease in Three Children.Authors: Bolia R, Chong SY, Coleman L, MacGregor D, Hardikar W, Oliver MRSource: ACG Case Rep J. 2016 Aug 31;3(4):e115. doi: 10.14309/crj.2016.88. eCollection 2016 Jul.Abstract: We report 3 children who presented with fever and abdominal pain, deranged liver function tests, and on abdominal ultrasound were found to have an enlarged pancreas, substantial abdominal lymphadenopathy, and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. After ruling out malignancy, probable immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4RD) associated with autoimmune pancreatitis was considered. This condition was first described in the adults and often mimics pancreatic cancer. It can involve multiple organs, either synchronously or metachronously, and is rarely reported in children. The disorder mostly responds to corticosteroid therapy and other immune suppression. We highlight the difficulty in diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis/IgG4-related disease in children and illustrate the difference between pediatric and adult presentation.PMID: 27622062Title: Warburg metabolism in tumor-conditioned macrophages promotes metastasis in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Authors: Penny HL, Sieow JL, Adriani G, Yeap WH, See Chi Ee P, San Luis B, Lee B, Lee T, Mak SY, Ho YS, Lam KP, Ong CK, Huang RY, Ginhoux F, Rotzschke O, Kamm RD, Wong SCSource: Oncoimmunology. 2016 Jun 21;5(8):e1191731. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1191731. eCollection 2016 Aug.Abstract: Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) face a clinically intractable disease with poor survival rates, attributed to exceptionally high levels of metastasis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is pronounced at inflammatory foci within the tumor; however, the immunological mechanisms promoting tumor dissemination remain unclear. It is well established that tumors exhibit the Warburg effect, a preferential use of glycolysis for energy production, even in the presence of oxygen, to support rapid growth. We hypothesized that the metabolic pathways utilized by tumor-infiltrating macrophages are altered in PDAC, conferring a pro-metastatic phenotype. We generated tumor-conditioned macrophages in vitro, in which human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured with conditioned media generated from normal pancreatic or PDAC cell lines to obtain steady-state and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. Compared with steady-state macrophages, TAMs promoted vascular network formation, augmented extravasation of tumor cells out of blood vessels, and induced higher levels of EMT. TAMs exhibited a pronounced glycolytic signature in a metabolic flux assay, corresponding with elevated glycolytic gene transcript levels. Inhibiting glycolysis in TAMs with a competitive inhibitor to Hexokinase II (HK2), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), was sufficient to disrupt this pro-metastatic phenotype, reversing the observed increases in TAM-supported angiogenesis, extravasation, and EMT. Our results indicate a key role for metabolic reprogramming of tumor-infiltrating macrophages in PDAC metastasis, and highlight the therapeutic potential of using pharmacologics to modulate these metabolic pathways.PMID: 27622013Title: The proto-oncogene Myc drives expression of the NK cell-activating NKp30 ligand B7-H6 in tumor cells.Authors: Textor S, Bossler F, Henrich KO, Gartlgruber M, Pollmann J, Fiegler N, Arnold A, Westermann F, Waldburger N, Breuhahn K, Golfier S, Witzens-Harig M, Cerwenka ASource: Oncoimmunology. 2016 Jul 28;5(7):e1116674. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2015.1116674. eCollection 2016 Jul.Abstract: Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate effector cells that are able to recognize and eliminate tumor cells through engagement of their surface receptors. NKp30 is a potent activating NK cell receptor that elicits efficient NK cell-mediated target cell killing. Recently, B7-H6 was identified as tumor cell surface expressed ligand for NKp30. Enhanced B7-H6 mRNA levels are frequently detected in tumor compared to healthy tissues. To gain insight in the regulation of expression of B7-H6 in tumors, we investigated transcriptional mechanisms driving B7-H6 expression by promoter analyses. Using luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation we mapped a functional binding site for Myc, a proto-oncogene overexpressed in certain tumors, in the B7-H6 promoter. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA/shRNA-mediated knock-down of c-Myc or N-Myc significantly decreased B7-H6 expression on a variety of tumor cells including melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. In tumor cell lines from different origin and primary tumor tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lymphoma and neuroblastoma, mRNA levels of c-Myc positively correlated with B7-H6 expression. Most importantly, upon inhibition or knock-down of c-Myc in tumor cells impaired NKp30-mediated degranulation of NK cells was observed. Thus, our data imply that Myc driven tumors could be targets for cancer immunotherapy exploiting the NKp30/B7-H6 axis.PMID: 27621649Title: Expression and prognostic significance of unique ULBPs in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Chen J, Zhu XX, Xu H, Fang HZ, Zhao JQSource: Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 25;9:5271-9. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S107771. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, due to the lack of efficient therapy and difficulty in early diagnosis. ULBPs have been shown to behave as important protectors with prognostic significance in various cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to explore the expression of ULBPs in cancer tissue and in serum, while survival analysis was used to evaluate the subsequent clinical value of ULBPs. RESULTS: Statistics showed that high expression of membrane ULBP1 was a good biomarker of overall survival (18 months vs 13 months), and a high level of soluble ULBP2 was deemed an independent poor indicator for both overall survival (P<0.001) and disease-free survival (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: ULBP1 provides additional information for early diagnosis, and soluble ULBP2 can be used as a novel tumor marker to evaluate the risk of pancreatic cancer patients.PMID: 27621576Title: Pancreatic cancer: Open or minimally invasive surgery?Authors: Zhang YH, Zhang CW, Hu ZM, Hong DFSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug 28;22(32):7301-10. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7301.Abstract: Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma is one of the most fatal malignancies, with R0 resection remaining the most important part of treatment of this malignancy. However, pancreatectomy is believed to be one of the most challenging procedures and R0 resection remains the only chance for patients with pancreatic cancer to have a good prognosis. Some surgeons have tried minimally invasive pancreatic surgery, but the short- and long-term outcomes of pancreatic malignancy remain controversial between open and minimally invasive procedures. We collected comparative data about minimally invasive and open pancreatic surgery. The available evidence suggests that minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD) is as safe and feasible as open PD (OPD), and shows some benefit, such as less intraoperative blood loss and shorter postoperative hospital stay. Despite the limited evidence for MIPD in pancreatic cancer, most of the available data show that the short-term oncological adequacy is similar between MIPD and OPD. Some surgical techniques, including superior mesenteric artery-first approach and laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy with major vein resection, are believed to improve the rate of R0 resection. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is less technically demanding and is accepted in more pancreatic centers. It is technically safe and feasible and has similar short-term oncological prognosis compared with open distal pancreatectomy.PMID: 27621574Title: Perspectives on the combination of radiotherapy and targeted therapy with DNA repair inhibitors in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.Authors: Yang SH, Kuo TC, Wu H, Guo JC, Hsu C, Hsu CH, Tien YW, Yeh KH, Cheng AL, Kuo SHSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug 28;22(32):7275-88. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7275.Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal. Current research that combines radiation with targeted therapy may dramatically improve prognosis. Cancerous cells are characterized by unstable genomes and activation of DNA repair pathways, which are indicated by increased phosphorylation of numerous factors, including H2AX, ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, DNA-PKcs, Rad51, and Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers. Radiotherapy causes DNA damage. Cancer cells can be made more sensitive to the effects of radiation (radiosensitization) through inhibition of DNA repair pathways. The synergistic effects, of two or more combined non-lethal treatments, led to co-administration of chemotherapy and radiosensitization in BRCA-defective cells and patients, with promising results. ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways are principal regulators of cell cycle arrest, following DNA double-strand or single-strand breaks. DNA double-stranded breaks activate DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). It forms a holoenzyme with Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers, called DNA-PK, which catalyzes the joining of nonhomologous ends. This is the primary repair pathway utilized in human cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Radiosensitization, induced by inhibitors of ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, Wee1, PP2A, or DNA-PK, has been demonstrated in preclinical pancreatic cancer studies. Clinical trials are underway. Development of agents that inhibit DNA repair pathways to be clinically used in combination with radiotherapy is warranted for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27621566Title: Pancreatic cancer: Are "liquid biopsies" ready for prime-time?Authors: Lewis AR, Valle JW, McNamara MGSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug 28;22(32):7175-85. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7175.Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is a disease that carries a poor prognosis. Accurate tissue diagnosis is required. Tumours contain a high content of stromal tissue and therefore biopsies may be inconclusive. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) have been investigated as a potential "liquid biopsy" in several malignancies and have proven to be of prognostic value in breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. They have been detected in patients with localised and metastatic pancreatic cancer with sensitivities ranging from 38%-100% using a variety of platforms. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has also been detected in pancreas cancer with a sensitivity ranging from 26%-100% in studies across different platforms and using different genetic markers. However, there is no clear consensus on which platform is the most effective for detection, nor which genetic markers are the most useful to use. Potential roles of liquid biopsies include diagnosis, screening, guiding therapies and prognosis. The presence of CTCs or ctDNA has been shown to be of prognostic value both at diagnosis and after treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, more prospective studies are required before this promising technology is ready for adoption into routine clinical practice.PMID: 27621395Title: PANCREOX: A Randomized Phase III Study of 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin With or Without Oxaliplatin for Second-Line Advanced Pancreatic Cancer in Patients Who Have Received Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy.Authors: Gill S, Ko YJ, Cripps C, Beaudoin A, Dhesy-Thind S, Zulfiqar M, Zalewski P, Do T, Cano P, Lam WY, Dowden S, Grassin H, Stewart J, Moore MSource: J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 12. pii: JCO685776.Abstract: PURPOSE: The standard of care for second-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after gemcitabine-based therapy is not clearly defined. The CONKO-003 phase III study reported a survival benefit with second-line fluorouracil (FU) and oxaliplatin using the oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and FU (OFF) regimen.1 PANCREOX was a phase III multicenter trial to evaluate the benefit of FU and oxaliplatin administered as modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6; infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) versus infusional FU/leucovorin (LV) in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with confirmed advanced pancreatic cancer who were previously treated with gemcitabine therapy and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were eligible. A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive biweekly mFOLFOX6 or infusional FU/LV until progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics were similar in both arms. No difference was observed in PFS (median, 3.1 months v 2.9 months; P = .99). Overall survival (OS) was inferior in patients assigned to mFOLFOX6 (median, 6.1 months v 9.9 months; P = .02). Increased toxicity was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, with grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in 63% of patients who received mFOLFOX6 and 11% of those who received FU/LV. More patients in the mFOLFOX6 arm withdrew from study due to adverse events than in the FU/LV arm (20% v 2%), whereas the use of postprogression therapy was significantly higher in the FU/LV arm (25% v 7%; P = .015). No significant differences were observed in time to deterioration on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 global health scale. CONCLUSION: No benefit was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, administered as mFOLFOX6, versus infusional FU/LV in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer previously treated with first-line gemcitabine.PMID: 27621394Title: Everolimus for the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: Overall Survival and Circulating Biomarkers From the Randomized, Phase III RADIANT-3 Study.Authors: Yao JC, Pavel M, Lombard-Bohas C, Van Cutsem E, Voi M, Brandt U, He W, Chen D, Capdevila J, de Vries EG, Tomassetti P, Hobday T, Pommier R, Oberg KSource: J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 12. pii: JCO680702.Abstract: PURPOSE: Everolimus improved median progression-free survival by 6.4 months in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) compared with placebo in the RADIANT-3 study. Here, we present the final overall survival (OS) data and data on the impact of biomarkers on OS from the RADIANT-3 study. METHODS: Patients with advanced, progressive, low- or intermediate-grade pancreatic NET were randomly assigned to everolimus 10 mg/day (n = 207) or placebo (n = 203). Crossover from placebo to open-label everolimus was allowed on disease progression. Ongoing patients were unblinded after final progression-free survival analysis and could transition to open-label everolimus at the investigator's discretion (extension phase). OS analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test in the intent-to-treat population. The baseline levels of chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and multiple soluble angiogenic biomarkers were determined and their impact on OS was explored. RESULTS: Of 410 patients who were enrolled between July 2007 and March 2014, 225 received open-label everolimus, including 172 patients (85%) randomly assigned initially to the placebo arm. Median OS was 44.0 months (95% CI, 35.6 to 51.8 months) for those randomly assigned to everolimus and 37.7 months (95% CI, 29.1 to 45.8 months) for those randomly assigned to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.20; P = .30). Elevated baseline chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, placental growth factor, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 levels were poor prognostic factors for OS. The most common adverse events included stomatitis, rash, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Everolimus was associated with a median OS of 44 months in patients with advanced, progressive pancreatic NET, the longest OS reported in a phase III study for this population. Everolimus was associated with a survival benefit of 6.3 months, although this finding was not statistically significant. Crossover of patients likely confounded the OS results.PMID: 27621388Title: Neoadjuvant Therapy Followed by Resection Versus Upfront Resection for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.Authors: Mokdad AA, Minter RM, Zhu H, Augustine MM, Porembka MR, Wang SC, Yopp AC, Mansour JC, Choti MA, Polanco PMSource: J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 12. pii: JCO685081.Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare overall survival between patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by resection and those who received upfront resection (UR)-as well as a subgroup of UR patients who also received adjuvant therapy-for early-stage resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with resected, clinical stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas were identified in the National Cancer Database from 2006 to 2012. Patients who underwent NAT followed by curative-intent resection were matched by propensity score with patients whose tumors were resected upfront. Overall survival was compared by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Early postoperative and oncologic outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: We identified 15,237 patients with clinical stage I or II resected pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. From the NAT group, 2,005 patients (95%) were matched with 6,015 patients who underwent UR. The NAT group was associated with improved survival compared with UR (median survival, 26 months v 21 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P < .01; hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.78). Patients in the UR group had higher pathologic T stage (pT3 and T4: 86% v 73%; P < .01), higher positive lymph nodes (73% v 48%; P < .01), and higher positive resection margin (24% v 17%; P < .01). Compared with a subset of UR patients who received adjuvant therapy, NAT patients had a better survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.89). CONCLUSION: NAT followed by resection has a significant survival benefit compared with UR in early-stage, resected pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. These findings support the use of NAT, particularly as a patient selection tool, in the management of resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.PMID: 27621334Title: Striving to Move Beyond Chemotherapy in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Ko AHSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):808-10. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.015933.Abstract: ?PMID: 27621333Title: Is There Efficacy Beyond Cytotoxic Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer?Authors: Kalyan A, Benson AB 3rdSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):806-7. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.015883.Abstract: ?PMID: 27621332Title: Current and Evolving Therapies for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: Are We Stuck With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy?Authors: Varadhachary GR, Wolff RASource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):797-805. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.015586.Abstract: At present, front-line therapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is combination chemotherapy, most commonly FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel. Despite a better understanding of the genomic landscape and the importance of the tumor microenvironment, we have not made a seismic shift in the overall survival for this disease. Given our growing understanding of the biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the question remains whether novel, noncytotoxic agents will augment or even replace conventional chemotherapy. The thrust of ongoing efforts can be divided into broad categories, including exploiting the DNA damage repair phenotype, stroma and specific pathway-targeting agents, and enhancing immune destruction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In this article, we review the current and evolving therapeutic landscape of metastatic pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27621328Title: Preoperative Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer: The Tide Is Turning.Authors: Katz MHSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):783-4. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.016360.Abstract: ?PMID: 27621327Title: Is It Time for Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma?Authors: Hoffman JP, Reddy SSSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):780-1. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.016352.Abstract: ?PMID: 27621326Title: Evolution of the Management of Resectable Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Tsai S, Erickson BA, Dua K, Ritch PS, Tolat P, Evans DBSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep;12(9):772-8. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.015818.Abstract: In pancreatic cancer, as with many other solid tumors, a commonly held surgical adage-a chance to cut is a chance to cure-has been promulgated throughout the years. Following such reasoning, surgical extirpation of a localized tumor would prevent tumor dissemination and metastatic tumor progression. However, decades of surgical experience have demonstrated that surgical resection alone provides a limited median survival benefit. Despite the optimization of surgical technique and perioperative management over the past three decades, little progress has been made to improve the limited survival of patients with localized pancreatic cancer who receive surgery. In this article, we discuss the rationale for a novel management strategy for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, which may improve patient selection and the delivery of multimodality therapy.PMID: 27620742Title: Survival variability of controls and definition of imaging endpoints for longitudinal follow-up of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in rats.Authors: Akladios C, Ignat M, Mutter D, Aprahamian MSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The 3Rs guideline is the gold standard for ethics in animal experimentation. Two of those rules, namely refinement and reduction, require further improvement. The objective of this study was to define pathways to better compliance with these prerequisites. Two methods which move us in this direction are: (1) using small animal imaging techniques for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) follow-up and (2) reduction of the number of control animals included in a study of PDAC progression under treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, we used MicroCT scan to diagnose events showing PDAC progression prior to any clinical symptoms to thereby define more humane endpoints identifiable before any painful phenomenon is observed. Secondly, in order to test the hypothesis of using a reference control group in all preclinical studies of a new treatment of PDAC, we investigated the stability of the results obtained with the control groups in three successive identical studies comparing placebo and gemcitabine in tumor-bearing Lewis rats. RESULTS: Two imaging endpoints were found. The first was the observation of a liver metastasis assessing PDAC diffusion and, earlier than liver metastasis, the presence of bands of fluid along the flanks, with more or less a medial displacement of bowel and solid viscera, reflecting a peritoneal ascites. Results of the longitudinal follow-up of rats in the gemcitabine study revealed heterogeneity in the survival rate in the three control groups, as opposed to the survival rate in the three treated groups which did not differ statistically. As a result, the significance of improved survival with chemotherapy varied greatly according to the control group used for the comparison, ranging from no impact to a highly significant effect. CONCLUSION: The early detection by the means of animal imaging of one or more signs indicating the onset of a critical step in the development of the disease (e.g., ascites or/and metastasis) allows the researcher to prevent the occurrence of animal pain, thereby ensuring better animal welfare. However, using a single standard control group in an effort to use fewer animals for a given model runs such a significant risk of false results that it mars the entire study. Although reducing the number of animals in a study remains the gold standard of our experimental practice, in this case it would come at the price of a loss of validity of the results.PMID: 27620728Title: Early hepatocellular carcinoma as a signaling lesion for subsequent malignancy.Authors: Midorikawa Y, Takayama T, Higaki T, Nakayama H, Yamamoto M, Ariizumi S, Shimada K, Kokudo N, Tsuji S, Tsuchiya K, Kurosaki M, Izumi NSource: Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer may contribute substantially to complete cure, but it remains unknown whether treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma can actually result in cure. This study was performed to clarify the cancer risk of the background liver after treating early hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Early hepatocellular carcinoma is defined as very well-differentiated cancer containing Glisson's triad. The cumulative incidence of classical hepatocellular carcinoma, hypervascular liver cancer detected on imaging studies, after resection of early hepatocellular carcinoma positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody (early hepatocellular carcinoma group, n = 105) was compared with that in patients with chronic liver disease positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody (control group, n = 751) and propensity score-matched patients after resection of classical hepatocellular carcinoma (classical hepatocellular carcinoma group, n = 105). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 0.3-15.0), the cumulative incidence of classical hepatocellular carcinoma at 5 years was 56.9% (95% confidence interval, 44.2-67.7%) in the early hepatocellular carcinoma group and 70.6% (52.5-81.8%) in the classical hepatocellular carcinoma group as compared with 4.6% (2.8-6.4%) in the control group. The risk of the development of classical hepatocellular carcinoma in the early hepatocellular carcinoma group was significantly higher than that in the control group (hazard ratio, 17.5; 95% confidence interval, 12.1-25.3; P < 0.001) and significantly lower than that in the classical hepatocellular carcinoma group (hazard ratio, 0.60; 0.41-0.89; P = 0.010). However, the cumulative incidence of second primary hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with one early hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly from that in patients with two or more early hepatocellular carcinoma lesions (hazard ratio, 1.50; 0.85-2.65; P = 0.157). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma cannot provide complete cure due to the substantial risk of developing classical hepatocellular carcinoma.PMID: 27620132Title: Pancreaticobiliary Maljunctions in European Patients with Bile Duct Cysts: Results of the Multicenter Study of the French Surgical Association (AFC).Authors: Ragot E, Mabrut JY, Ouaissi M, Sauvanet A, Dokmak S, Nuzzo G, Halkic N, Dubois R, Letoublon C, Cherqui D, Azoulay D, Irtan S, Boudjema K, Pruvot FR, Gigot JF, Kianmanesh RSource: World J Surg. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreaticobiliary maljunctions (PBMs) are congenital anomalies of the junction between pancreatic and bile ducts, frequently associated with bile duct cyst (BDC). BDC is congenital biliary tree diseases that are characterized by distinctive dilatation types of the extra- and/or intrahepatic bile ducts. Todani's types I and IVa, in which dilatation involves principally the main bile duct, are the most frequent. PBM induces pancreatic juice reflux into the biliary tract that is supposed to be one of the main factors of biliary cancer degeneration, although the diagnostic criteria of PBM that can be either morphological and/or functional are not well defined especially in Western series. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relative prevalence of PBM in BDC in a large European multicenter study, to analyze the characteristics of PBM and try to propose diagnostic criteria of PBMs based on morphological and/or functional criteria and define the positive, negative predictive values, sensibility and specificity of either criteria. RESULTS: From 1975 to 2012, 263 patients with BDC were analyzed. Among them, 190 (72.2 %) were considered to present PBM. Types I and IVa had a similar rate of PBM association. According to the "AFC classification," 57.2 % had a C-P type, 34.5 % a P-C type and 8.3 % a complex type ("anse-de-seau"). The median length of the common channel in patients with PBM was 15.8 +/- 6.8 mm (range 5-40 mm). The median intrabiliary amylase and lipase levels were 65,249 and 172,104 UI/L, respectively. For the diagnostic of PBM, a common channel length of more than 8 mm and an intrabiliary amylase level superior to 8000 UI/L were associated with a predictive positive value and a specificity of more than 90 %. Synchronous biliary cancer had an incidence of 8.7 % in all patients with BDC and PBM 11.1 % in adults. Compared to type IV, the type I BDC was associated with statistically more cancer patients in the presence of PBM. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of PBM associated with BDC in Western population are quite close to reported Eastern series. The results suggest considering both the intrabiliary value of amylase >8000 UI/L and a length of a common channel >8 mm as appropriate values for positive diagnosis of PBM.PMID: 27619942Title: Influence of Total Lymph Node Count on Staging and Survival After Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: An Analysis From a Two-Institution Database in China.Authors: Lu J, Wang W, Zheng CH, Fang C, Li P, Xie JW, Wang JB, Lin JX, Chen QY, Cao LL, Lin M, Huang CM, Zhou ZWSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines suggest that 16 or more lymph nodes (LNs) are required for the appropriate staging of gastric cancer, the effect that the minimum number of examined LNs (eLNs) in the different types of gastrectomy has on survival remains unclear. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 2662 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from January 2000 to December 2010 and randomly divided them into development (70 %, n = 1863) and validation (30 %, n = 799) data sets. An additional external validation was performed using the data set (n = 285) collected during the same period from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in Guangzhou, China. A hypothetical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (hTNM) was proposed based on eLNs and survival. RESULTS: The mean numbers of nodes removed during radical distal and total gastrectomy were respectively 26 +/- 9.6 and 29 +/- 10.7 (p < 0.01). The optimal LN-count thresholds were determined to be 16 for patients who underwent curative distal gastrectomy and 21 for patients who underwent total gastrectomy. The hTNM staging system had higher linear trend and likelihood ratio chi 2 scores and lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) values than the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification. Thus, the hTNM staging system exhibited superior prognostic stratification. Similar results were found in the two validation data sets. CONCLUSION: A harvest of at least 21 LNs may represent a superior threshold for radical total gastrectomy (RTG) and could yield a better prognosis. For patients undergoing RTG, the hTNM staging system may predict survival more accurately and discriminatively. However, a validation from a Western institution is warranted.PMID: 27619939Title: Postoperative Complications and Long-Term Survival After Complex Cancer Resection.Authors: Nathan H, Yin H, Wong SLSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent attention has focused on the ability to rescue patients from postoperative complications and prevent short-term mortality. However, it is unknown whether patients rescued from complications after complex cancer resections have long-term survival outcomes similar to those of patients without complications. METHODS: From 2005 to 2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, the study identified elderly patients who underwent resection for cancers of the esophagus, lung, or pancreas. The association of risk-adjusted long-term survival with serious complications, minor complications, and no complications was analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 905 patients with esophageal cancer, 12,395 patients with lung cancer, and 1966 patients with pancreatic cancer. The serious complication rates were respectively 17.4, 9.5 and 11.8 %. The patients with serious complications had lower 5-year survival rates than those with no complications even if they were rescued and survived 30 days (20 vs 43 % for esophagus, 29 vs 54 % for lung, and 10 vs 21 % for pancreas cancer). Even after patients who died within 180 days after surgery were excluded from the analysis, a decrement in risk-adjusted long-term survival was observed among the patients with serious complications after all three procedures. The association between complications and long-term survival was not explained by differences in receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo complex cancer resection and experience serious complications have diminished long-term survival, even if they are "rescued" from their complications. This finding persists even when deaths within 6 months after surgery are excluded from the analysis. Metrics of surgical success should consider terms beyond 30 and even 90 days as well as the long-term consequences of surgical complications.PMID: 27619800Title: A phase-I trial of pre-operative, margin intensive, stereotactic body radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer: the 'SPARC' trial protocol.Authors: Holyoake DL, Ward E, Grose D, McIntosh D, Sebag-Montefiore D, Radhakrishna G, Patel N, Silva M, Mukherjee S, Strauss VY, Odondi L, Fokas E, Melcher A, Hawkins MASource: BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 13;16(1):728. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2765-4.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Standard therapy for borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer in the UK is surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy, but rates of resection with clear margins are unsatisfactory and overall survival remains poor. Meta-analysis of single-arm studies shows the potential of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy but the relative radio-resistance of pancreatic cancer means the efficacy of conventional dose schedules is limited. Stereotactic radiotherapy achieves sufficient accuracy and precision to enable pre-operative margin-intensive dose escalation with the goal of increasing rates of clear resection margins and local disease control. METHODS/DESIGN: SPARC is a "rolling-six" design single-arm study to establish the maximum tolerated dose for margin-intensive stereotactic radiotherapy before resection of pancreatic cancer at high risk of positive resection margins. Eligible patients will have histologically or cytologically proven pancreatic cancer defined as borderline-resectable per National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria or operable tumour in contact with vessels increasing the risk of positive margin. Up to 24 patients will be recruited from up to 5 treating centres and a 'rolling-six' design is utilised to minimise delays and facilitate ongoing recruitment during dose-escalation. Radiotherapy will be delivered in 5 daily fractions and surgery, if appropriate, will take place 5-6 weeks after radiotherapy. The margin-intense radiotherapy concept includes a systematic method to define the target volume for a simultaneous integrated boost in the region of tumour-vessel infiltration, and up to 4 radiotherapy dose levels will be investigated. Maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients or 0 of 3 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity. Secondary endpoints include resection rate, resection margin status, response rate, overall survival and progression free survival at 12 and 24 months. Translational work will involve exploratory analyses of the cytological and humoral immunological responses to stereotactic radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Radiotherapy quality assurance of target definition and radiotherapy planning is enforced with pre-trial test cases and on-trial review. Recruitment began in April 2015. DISCUSSION: This prospective multi-centre study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of pre-operative margin-intensified stereotactic radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer at high risk of positive resection margins with a view to subsequent definitive comparison with other neoadjuvant treatment options.

Photodynamic therapy aims to bring about specific cytotoxic damage to tumours through delivery of a photosensitising agent and light irradiation. Conjugation to biological molecules that specifically target cancer has been shown to increase photosensitiser (PS) selectivity and decrease damage to surrounding normal tissue. The aim of this study was to target tumour cells with a PE-specific PS therefore duramycin was conjugated to a porphyrin based PS which was achieved via direct reaction with the epsilon-amino group on the lysine residue near duramycin's N-terminal. The compound was subsequently purified using RP-HPLC and confirmed using mass spectrometry. Binding of the conjugate to ovarian and pancreatic cancer cell lines was assessed by flow cytometry. Light irradiation with a light fluence of 7.5J/cm2 was delivered to conjugate treated cancer cells and cell proliferation analysed by MTT assay. The conjugate detected PE on all 4 cancer cell lines in a concentration dependent manner and conjugate plus irradiation effectively reduced cell proliferation at concentrations >/=0.5muM, dependent on cancer cell line. Reduction in cell proliferation by the irradiated conjugate was enhanced over unconjugated duramycin in A2780, AsPC-1 and SK-OV-3 (p<0.05). In this study we have shown that a duramycin-porphyrin conjugate retained good binding affinity for its target and, following irradiation, reduced cell proliferation of pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines.PMID: 27619253Title: Recent Advances and Prospects for Multimodality Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Chadha AS, Khoo A, Aliru ML, Arora HK, Gunther JR, Krishnan SSource: Semin Radiat Oncol. 2016 Oct;26(4):320-37. doi: 10.1016/j.semradonc.2016.05.002. Epub 2016 May 26.Abstract: The outcomes for treatment of pancreatic cancer have not improved dramatically in many decades. However, the recent promising results with combination chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease increase optimism for future treatments. With greater control of overt or occult metastatic disease, there will likely be an expanding role for local treatment modalities, especially given that nearly a third of pancreatic cancer patients have locally destructive disease without distant metastatic disease at the time of death. Technical advances have allowed for the safe delivery of dose-escalated radiation therapy, which can then be combined with chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapy, and nanoparticulate drug delivery techniques to produce novel and improved synergistic effects. Here we discuss recent advances and future directions for multimodality therapy in pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27618657Title: Efficacy of pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer in a randomized trial.Authors: Woo SM, Joo J, Kim SY, Park SJ, Han SS, Kim TH, Koh YH, Chung SH, Kim YH, Moon H, Hong EK, Lee WJSource: Pancreatology. 2016 Sep 4. pii: S1424-3903(16)31182-6. doi: 10.1016/j.pan.2016.09.001.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Weight loss in pancreatic cancer is associated with maldigestion due to pancreatic duct obstruction. Pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy (PERT) may significantly improve fat and protein absorption. OBJECTIVES: This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial assessed whether PERT could reduce or prevent weight loss in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Sixty seven patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were randomized to receive enteric coated PERT, consisting of 6-9 capsules of pancreatin (457.7 mg/capsule), or placebo. Patients took two capsules each three times daily during main meals and one capsule each up to three times daily when having between-meal snacks. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in body weight at eight weeks. RESULTS: The mean percentage change in body weight (1.49% [1.12 kg] vs. 2.99% [1.63 kg], P = 0.381) and the mean percent change in Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score (8.85% vs. 15.69%, p = 0.18) did not differ significantly between the PERT and placebo groups. There was no improvement in quality of life and overall survival did not differ significantly between the PERT and placebo groups (5.84 months vs 8.13 months, p = 0.744). CONCLUSIONS: PERT did not reduce weight loss in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Larger randomized trials are needed to identify those patients who may benefit from PERT.

Hybrid imaging utilizing PET-CT and PET-MRI are novel imaging modalities that are changing the current landscape in cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment response. MRI has shown to have higher sensitivity in soft tissue, head and neck pathology, and pelvic disease, as well as, detecting small metastases in the liver and bone compared to CT. Combining MRI with PET allows for detection of metastases that may have been missed with current imaging modalities. In this review, we will examine the clinical utility of FDG PET-MRI in the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal cancers with focus on esophageal, stomach, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. We will also explore its role in treatment response and future directions associated with it.PMID: 27617577Title: RN1, a novel galectin-3 inhibitor, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo via blocking galectin-3 associated signaling pathways.Authors: Zhang L, Wang P, Qin Y, Cong Q, Shao C, Du Z, Ni X, Li P, Ding KSource: Oncogene. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.306.Abstract: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.306.PMID: 27617390Title: An in vivo multiplexed small-molecule screening platform.Authors: Gruner BM, Schulze CJ, Yang D, Ogasawara D, Dix MM, Rogers ZN, Chuang CH, McFarland CD, Chiou SH, Brown JM, Cravatt BF, Bogyo M, Winslow MMSource: Nat Methods. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.3992.Abstract: Phenotype-based small-molecule screening is a powerful method to identify molecules that regulate cellular functions. However, such screens are generally performed in vitro under conditions that do not necessarily model complex physiological conditions or disease states. Here, we use molecular cell barcoding to enable direct in vivo phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries. The multiplexed nature of this approach allows rapid in vivo analysis of hundreds to thousands of compounds. Using this platform, we screened >700 covalent inhibitors directed toward hydrolases for their effect on pancreatic cancer metastatic seeding. We identified multiple hits and confirmed the relevant target of one compound as the lipase ABHD6. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirmed the role of this enzyme as a regulator of metastatic fitness. Our results highlight the applicability of this multiplexed screening platform for investigating complex processes in vivo.PMID: 27617308Title: Adipocytes promote pancreatic cancer cell proliferation via glutamine transfer.Authors: Meyer KA, Neeley CK, Baker NA, Washabaugh AR, Flesher CG, Nelson BS, Frankel TL, Lumeng CN, Lyssiotis CA, Wynn ML, Rhim AD, O'Rourke RWSource: Biochem Biophys Rep. 2016 Sep;7:144-149. Epub 2016 Jun 7.Abstract: Adipocytes promote progression of multiple cancers, but their role in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly defined. Nutrient transfer is a mechanism underlying stromal cell-cancer crosstalk. We studied the role of adipocytes in regulating in vitro PanIN and PDAC cell proliferation with a focus on glutamine metabolism. Murine 3T3L1 adipocytes were used to model adipocytes. Cell lines derived from PKCY mice were used to model PanIN and PDAC. Co-culture was used to study the effect of adipocytes on PanIN and PDAC cell proliferation in response to manipulation of glutamine metabolism. Glutamine secretion was measured with a bioanalyzer. Western blotting was used to study the effect of PanIN and PDAC cells on expression of glutamine-related enzymes in adipocytes. Adipocytes promote proliferation of PanIN and PDAC cells, an effect that was amplified in nutrient-poor conditions. Adipocytes secrete glutamine and rescue PanIN and PDAC cell proliferation in the absence of glutamine, an effect that was glutamine synthetase-dependent and involved PDAC cell-induced down-regulation of glutaminase expression in adipocytes. These findings suggest glutamine transfer as a potential mechanism underlying adipocyte-induced PanIN and PDAC cell proliferation.PMID: 27617257Title: Celiac axis stenosis as a rare but critical condition treated with pancreatoduodenectomy: report of 2 cases.Authors: Park HM, Lee SD, Lee EC, Lee IJ, Han SS, Kim HB, Kim SH, Lee SA, Park SJSource: Ann Surg Treat Res. 2016 Sep;91(3):149-53. doi: 10.4174/astr.2016.91.3.149. Epub 2016 Aug 29.Abstract: We describe 2 cases of patients with loss of hepatic arterial flow during surgery for pancreatic head cancer due to celiac stenosis caused by median arcuate ligament compression. The first case underwent pylorus-resecting pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer. After resection of the gastroduodenal artery, flow in the common hepatic artery disappeared, and celiac axis stenosis was identified. Interventional stent insertion was attempted, however, it failed due to the acute angle of the celiac orifice (os). This problem was resolved by arterial reconstruction. The second case underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer and the same phenomenon occurred during the procedure. Interventional stent insertion was also tried; in this patient, however, it failed due to the acute angle of the celiac os. The problem was resolved by changing a femoral approach to a brachial approach, and the stent was inserted into the celiac os successfully.PMID: 27617235Title: A Study of The Effects of Novel Rhenium Compounds on Pancreatic and Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.Authors: Banerjee HN, Boston A, Barfield A, Stevenson M, Sarkar FH, Giri D, Winstead A, Krause JA, Mandal SKSource: Int J Sci Res (Ahmedabad). 2016 Jul;5(7). pii: 10501.Abstract: ?PMID: 27617152Title: Von Hippel-Lindau Disease.Authors: Findeis-Hosey JJ, McMahon KQ, Findeis SKSource: J Pediatr Genet. 2016 Jun;5(2):116-23. doi: 10.1055/s-0036-1579757. Epub 2016 Apr 4.Abstract: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome which occurs secondary to germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 3. Clinically von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by an increased risk of developing simple visceral cysts, most commonly in the pancreas and kidneys, in addition to an increased risk of developing neoplasms, often with clear cell features, in a multitude of organ systems. The most common neoplasms are cerebellar and retinal hemangioblastomas, adrenal pheochromocytomas, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic serous cystadenomas, and endolymphatic sac tumors. These lesions most commonly present during adulthood; however, screening and surveillance for the development of these lesions should begin in the pediatric years for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. In this review article, the genetics and most common neoplasms of von Hippel-Lindau disease are reviewed, with an eye towards implications for the pediatric patient.PMID: 27616660Title: Tumor stroma-containing 3D spheroid arrays: A tool to study nanoparticle penetration.Authors: Priwitaningrum DL, Blonde JB, van Baarlen J, Hennink WE, Storm G, Le Gac S, Prakash JSource: J Control Release. 2016 Sep 8. pii: S0168-3659(16)30690-3. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.09.004.Abstract: Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 4T1 and 3T3 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 1:5) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of alpha-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both mono- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-htert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.PMID: 27616351Title: WEE1 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells is dependent on DNA repair status in a context dependent manner.Authors: Lal S, Zarei M, Chand SN, Dylgjeri E, Mambelli-Lisboa NC, Pishvaian MJ, Yeo CJ, Winter JM, Brody JRSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 12;6:33323. doi: 10.1038/srep33323.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease, in part, because of the lack of effective targeted therapeutic options. MK-1775 (also known as AZD1775), a mitotic inhibitor, has been demonstrated to enhance the anti-tumor effects of DNA damaging agents such as gemcitabine. We evaluated the efficacy of MK-1775 alone or in combination with DNA damaging agents (MMC or oxaliplatin) in PDA cell lines that are either DNA repair proficient (DDR-P) or deficient (DDR-D). PDA cell lines PL11, Hs 766T and Capan-1 harboring naturally selected mutations in DNA repair genes FANCC, FANCG and BRCA2 respectively, were less sensitive to MK-1775 as compared to two out of four representative DDR-P (MIA PaCa2 and PANC-1) cell lines. Accordingly, DDR-P cells exhibit reduced sensitivity to MK-1775 upon siRNA silencing of DNA repair genes, BRCA2 or FANCD2, compared to control cells. Only DDR-P cells showed increased apoptosis as a result of early mitotic entry and catastrophe compared to DDR-D cells. Taken together with other recently published reports, our results add another level of evidence that the efficacy of WEE1 inhibition is influenced by the DNA repair status of a cell and may also be dependent on the tumor type and model evaluated.PMID: 27615706Title: Widely metastatic atypical pituitary adenoma with mTOR pathway STK11(F298L) mutation treated with everolimus therapy.Authors: Donovan LE, Arnal AV, Wang SH, Odia YSource: CNS Oncol. 2016 Sep 12.Abstract: Pituitary adenomas are the commonest intracranial tumor, but metastases are rare (0.2% yearly incidence) and portend poor prognosis. CAPecitabine and TEMozolomide improved outcomes for neuroendocrine tumors. However, no chemotherapy is approved for refractory pituitary carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing revealed an actionable mTOR pathway STK11 mutation in a woman with adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary carcinoma refractory to six resections, radiation and CAPecitabine and TEMozolomide. Given efficacy in preclinical pancreatic cancer models with STK11 mutations, she received radiation and everolimus leading to clinical improvement and stability on MRI and PET for >6 months. She ultimately expired from widely metastatic disease. Next-generation sequencing can identify actionable mutations in rare or treatment refractory tumors. Earlier targeted therapy may improve outcomes.PMID: 27615132Title: Effects of ageing and senescence on pancreatic beta-cell function.Authors: Helman A, Avrahami D, Klochendler A, Glaser B, Kaestner KH, Ben-Porath I, Dor YSource: Diabetes Obes Metab. 2016 Sep;18 Suppl 1:58-62. doi: 10.1111/dom.12719.Abstract: Ageing is generally associated with deterioration of organ function and regenerative potential. In the case of pancreatic beta-cells, an age-related decline in proliferative potential is well documented, and was proposed to contribute to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the elderly. The effects of ageing on beta-cell function, namely glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), have not been studied as extensively. Recent work revealed that, surprisingly, beta-cells of mature mice and humans secrete more insulin than young beta-cells in response to high glucose concentrations, potentially serving to counteract age-related peripheral insulin resistance. This functional change appears to be orchestrated by p16(Ink4A) -driven cellular senescence and downstream remodelling of chromatin structure and DNA methylation, enhancing the expression of genes controlling beta-cell function. We propose that activation of the cellular senescence program drives life-long functional maturation of beta-cells, due to beta-cell hypertrophy, enhanced glucose uptake and more efficient mitochondrial metabolism, in parallel to locking these cells in a non-replicative state. We speculate that the beneficial aspects of this process can be harnessed to enhance GSIS. Other age-related mechanisms, which are currently poorly understood, act to increase basal insulin secretion levels also in low glucose conditions. This leads to an overall reduction in the amplitude of insulin secretion between low and high glucose at old age, which may contribute to a deterioration in metabolic control.PMID: 27614705Title: Literature-based knowledgebase of pancreatic cancer gene to prioritize the key genes and pathways.Authors: Liu Y, Sun J, Zhao MSource: J Genet Genomics. 2016 Jul 9. pii: S1673-8527(16)30031-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jgg.2016.04.006.Abstract: ?PMID: 27614585Title: The many faces of pancreatic serous cystadenoma: Radiologic and pathologic correlation.Authors: Chu LC, Singhi AD, Haroun RR, Hruban RH, Fishman EKSource: Diagn Interv Imaging. 2016 Sep 7. pii: S2211-5684(16)30179-6. doi: 10.1016/j.diii.2016.08.005.Abstract: Pancreatic serous cystadenoma can be categorized into microcystic, honeycomb, oligocystic, and solid patterns based on imaging appearance. The presence of typical computed tomography (CT) features helps to differentiate serous cystadenomas from other cystic and solid pancreatic masses. Cases with atypical features present a diagnostic challenge as they can mimic malignant neoplasms. This article reviews pathophysiology, prevalence, CT features, mimickers and recommendations for management of pancreatic serous cystadenoma.PMID: 27614453Title: The circular RNA ciRS-7 (Cdr1as) acts as a risk factor of hepatic microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.Authors: Xu L, Zhang M, Zheng X, Yi P, Lan C, Xu MSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 10.Abstract: PURPOSE: Circular RNAs (circRNA) represent a novel class of widespread and diverse endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in mammals. microRNA-7 (miR-7) is a well-demonstrated suppressor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies have showed that one such circRNA, ciRS-7 (also termed as Cdr1as) was the inhibitor and sponge of miR-7 in the embryonic zebrafish midbrain and islet cells. However, the relationships among ciRS-7, miR-7 and clinical features of HCC remain to be clarified. METHODS: Expression levels of ciRS-7, miR-7 and three miR-7-targeted mRNAs in 108 pairs of HCC and their matched non-tumor tissues were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein production of these three miR-7-targeted mRNAs was further verified by Western blot. The relationship between ciRS-7 level and clinicopathological features as well as the recurrence of HCC patients was analyzed. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to detect the risk factors of hepatic microvascular invasion (MVI). The correlation among ciRS-7, miR-7 and miR-7-targeted mRNAs was evaluated using Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference of ciRS-7 expression levels between the HCC tissues and the matched non-tumor tissues (0.67 +/- 1.49 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.45, p = 0.13), and the ciRS-7 levels in more than half of HCC tissues (65 out of 108, 60.2 %) were down-regulated when compared with their matched non-tumor tissues. However, the expression of ciRS-7 was significantly correlated with the following three clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients: age <40 years (p = 0.02), serum AFP >/=400 ng/microl (p < 0.01) and hepatic MVI (p = 0.03). Meanwhile, up-regulated ciRS-7 expression was not only an independent risk factor of hepatic MVI but also had a capable predictive ability for MVI (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.001) at the cut-off value of 0.135. Furthermore, the expression of ciRS-7 in HCC tissues with concurrent MVI was inversely correlated with that of miR-7 (r = -0.39, p = 0.007) and positively related with that of two miR-7-targeted genes [PIK3CD (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and p70S6K (r = 0.34, p = 0.021)]. In addition, the median recurrent time of patients from higher ciRS-7 level group was shorter than that of lower ciRS-7 group (18 vs. 25 months), but no significant difference was observed (p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of ciRS-7 were comparable between HCC and matched non-tumor tissues. However, the highly ciRS-7 expression in HCC tissues was significantly correlated with hepatic MVI, AFP level and younger age and thus partly related with the deterioration of HCC. Especially, ciRS-7 was one of the independent factors of hepatic MVI. These data suggested that ciRS-7 may be a promising biomarker of hepatic MVI and a novel therapy target for restraining MVI.PMID: 27614430Title: Bis(acetylacetonato)-oxidovanadium(IV) and sodium metavanadate inhibit cell proliferation via ROS-induced sustained MAPK/ERK activation but with elevated AKT activity in human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells.Authors: Wu JX, Hong YH, Yang XGSource: J Biol Inorg Chem. 2016 Sep 10.Abstract: In this study, the antiproliferative effect of bis(acetylacetonato)-oxidovanadium(IV) and sodium metavanadate and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in human pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC-1. The results showed that both exhibited an antiproliferative effect through inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and can also cause elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells. Moreover, the two vanadium compounds induced the activation of both PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways dose- and time-dependently, which could be counteracted with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In the presence of MEK-1 inhibitor, the degradation of Cdc25C, inactivation of Cdc2 and accumulation of p21 were relieved. However, the treatment of AKT inhibitor did not cause any significant effect. Therefore, it demonstrated that the ROS-induced sustained MAPK/ERK activation rather than AKT contributed to vanadium compounds-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. The current results also exhibited that the two vanadium compounds did not induce a sustained increase of ROS generation, but the level of ROS reached a plateau instead. The results revealed that an intracellular feedback loop may be against the elevated ROS level induced by vanadate or VO(acac)2, evidenced by the increased GSH content, the unchanged level at the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, vanadium compounds can be regarded as a novel type of anticancer drugs through the prolonged activation of MAPK/ERK pathway but retained AKT activity. The present results provided a proof-of-concept evidence that vanadium-based compounds may have the potential as both antidiabetic and antipancreatic cancer agents to prevent or treat patients suffering from both diseases.PMID: 27614417Title: External radiation is associated with limited improvement in overall survival in resected margin-negative stage IIB pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Authors: Kantor O, Talamonti MS, Lutfi W, Wang CH, Winchester DJ, Marsh R, Prinz RA, Baker MSSource: Surgery. 2016 Sep 7. pii: S0039-6060(16)30410-X. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2016.07.033.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The absolute benefit of adjuvant external beam radiation therapy after a margin-negative resection in early stage pancreatic cancer has not been determined. METHODS: We queried the National Cancer Data Base for patients with pathologic stage I-II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent operative resection between 2004 and 2012. Multivariate Cox regression adjusted for age, race, comorbidities, facility type, location and volume, type of pancreatectomy, and tumor grade was used to estimate stage-specific survival. RESULTS: A total of 15,966 patients with stage I-II pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent upfront operative therapy (no neoadjuvant treatment) and had a margin-negative resection during the study period. A total of 835 (5.2%) patients were pathologic stage IA, 1,539 (9.5%) were stage IB, 3,378 (20.9%) were stage IIA, and 10,214 (63.1%) were stage IIB. Chemoradiation utilization increased with increasing stage (22.8% in stage IA vs 39.6% in stage IIB, P < .01). Chemoradiation was more common at low-volume centers (39.0% vs 31.7% at high-volume centers, P < .01) and with younger age (43.3% of patients <70 years old compared to 25.0% >/=70 years old, P < .01). Treatment at a high-volume center was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio 0.80-0.89) across all stages. Age >/=70 years old (hazard ratio 1.18-1.29, P < .01) and higher grade (hazard ratio 1.68-2.69, P < .01) were associated with higher risk of mortality at all stages. Chemoradiation was associated with a benefit in median overall survival over chemotherapy alone for stage IIB disease (21.8 months vs 19.5 months, P < .01). Chemoradiation was not associated with a significant benefit in median overall survival for stage IA, IB, or IIA disease (P > .30). CONCLUSION: Addition of radiation to adjuvant chemotherapy after margin-negative resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is associated with a limited survival benefit in patients with pathologic stage IIB disease and should be weighed against its associated risks in these patient groups.PMID: 27613843Title: Metabolic flux-driven sialylation alters internalization, recycling, and drug sensitivity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells.Authors: Mathew MP, Tan E, Saeui CT, Bovonratwet P, Sklar S, Bhattacharya R, Yarema KJSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11582.Abstract: In prior work we reported that advanced stage, drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (the SW1990 line) can be sensitized to the EGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib by treatment with 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2015) 25(6):1223-7). Here we provide mechanistic insights into how this compound inhibits EGFR activity and provides synergy with TKI drugs. First, we showed that the sialylation of the EGFR receptor was at most only modestly enhanced (by ~20 to 30%) compared to overall ~2-fold increase in cell surface levels of this sugar. Second, flux-driven sialylation did not alter EGFR dimerization as has been reported for cancer cell lines that experience increased sialylation due to spontaneous mutations. Instead, we present evidence that 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc treatment weakens the galectin lattice, increases the internalization of EGFR, and shifts endosomal trafficking towards non-clathrin mediated (NCM) endocytosis. Finally, by evaluating downstream targets of EGFR signaling, we linked synergy between 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc and existing TKI drugs to a shift from clathrin-coated endocytosis (which allows EGFR signaling to continue after internalization) towards NCM endocytosis, which targets internalized moieties for degradation and thereby rapidly diminishes signaling.PMID: 27613834Title: Generation and molecular characterization of pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenografts reveals their heterologous nature.Authors: Jung J, Lee HC, Seol HS, Choi YS, Kim E, Lee EJ, Rhee JK, Singh SR, Jun ES, Han B, Hong SM, Kim SC, Chang SSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 23. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11530.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most challenging type of cancer to treat, with a 5-year survival rate of <10%. Furthermore, because of the large portion of the inoperable cases, it is difficult to obtain specimens to study the biology of the tumors. Therefore, a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is an attractive option for preserving and expanding these tumors for translational research. Here we report the generation and characterization of 20 PDX models of PDAC. The success rate of the initial graft was 74% and most tumors were re-transplantable. Histological analysis of the PDXs and primary tumors revealed a conserved expression pattern of p53 and SMAD4; an exome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and Comprehensive Cancer Panel showed that PDXs retained over 94% of cancer-associated variants. In addition, Polyphen2 and the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) prediction identified 623 variants among the functional SNPs, highlighting the heterologous nature of pancreatic PDXs; an analysis of 409 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in Comprehensive Cancer Panel revealed heterologous cancer gene mutation profiles for each PDX-primary tumor pair. Altogether, we expect these PDX models are a promising platform for screening novel therapeutic agents and diagnostic markers for the detection and eradication of PDAC.PMID: 27613829Title: Dihydroartemisinin suppresses pancreatic cancer cells via a microRNA-mRNA regulatory network.Authors: Li Y, Wang Y, Kong R, Xue D, Pan S, Chen H, Sun BSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 23. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11517.Abstract: Despite improvements in surgical procedures and chemotherapy, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive and fatal human malignancies, with a low 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Therefore, novel strategies for prevention and treatment are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-pancreatic cancer effects dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Microarray and systematic analysis showed that DHA suppressed proliferation, inhibited angiogenesis and promoted apoptosis in two different human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and that 5 DHA-regulated microRNAs and 11 of their target mRNAs were involved in these effects via 19 microRNA-mRNA interactions. Four of these microRNAs, 9 of the mRNAs and 17 of the interactions were experimentally verified. Furthermore, we found that the anti-pancreatic caner effects of DHA in vivo involved 4 microRNAs, 9 mRNAs and 17 microRNA-mRNA interactions. These results improve the understanding of the mechanisms by which DHA suppresses proliferation and angiogenesis and promotes apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and indicate that DHA, an effective antimalarial drug, might improve pancreatic cancer treatments.PMID: 27613735Title: National Trends in Postoperative Outcomes and Cost Comparing Minimally Invasive Versus Open Liver and Pancreatic Surgery.Authors: Okunrintemi V, Gani F, Pawlik TMSource: J Gastrointest Surg. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been associated with improved postoperative clinical outcomes, the widespread use of MIS by procedure and hospital has been limited. We sought to report on national trends postoperative clinical outcomes for minimally invasive liver and pancreatic surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing an elective liver or pancreatic resection were identified using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2002 and 2012. Multivariable regression analysis was used to compare postoperative outcomes, and total hospital costs between patients who underwent a MIS versus an open resection over the study time period. RESULTS: A total of 47,685 patients were identified; 21,280 (44.6 %) patients underwent a hepatic resection while 26,405(55.4 %) patients underwent a pancreatic resection. MIS was performed in 2674 (5.6 %) patients and increased from 2.6 % in 2002 to 9.6 % in 2012 (p < 0.001); this trend was observed for both pancreatic and liver resections (both p < 0.001). Over the study time period, use of MIS was consistently associated with improved postoperative outcomes including decreased postoperative morbidity (open vs. MIS: 32.9 vs. 29.6 %) and a shorter length-of-stay (</=4 days; MIS, 21.4 %; Open, 13.7 %; both p < 0.05). The median costs associated with MIS decreased over time compared with the open surgical approach and were on average $572 lower than the cost associated with open surgery. CONCLUSION: Compared to open resection, MIS was associated with lower postoperative morbidity, a shorter length-of-stay, and lower cost. The use of MIS should be encouraged in order to improve postoperative outcomes and decrease healthcare spending via value enhancement.PMID: 27613577Title: Molecular targeted therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: A review of completed and ongoing late phase clinical trials.Authors: Mosquera C, Maglic D, Zervos EESource: Cancer Genet. 2016 Aug 2. pii: S2210-7762(16)30223-X. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2016.07.003.Abstract: Molecular targeted therapy is widely utilized and effective in a number of solid tumors. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, targeted therapy has been extensively evaluated; however, survival improvement of this aggressive disease using a targeted strategy has been minimal. The purpose of this study is to review therapeutic molecular targets in completed and ongoing later phase (II and III) clinical trials to have a better understanding of the rationale and progress towards targeted molecular therapies for pancreatic cancer. The PubMed database and the NCDI clinical trial website (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were queried to identify phase II and III completed and published (PubMed) and ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov) trials using the keywords: pancreatic cancer and molecular targeted therapy. The search engines were further limited by adding Phase II or III, active enrollment and North American. A total of 14 completed and published phase II/III clinical trials and 17 ongoing trials were identified. Evaluated strategies included inhibition of growth factor receptors (EGFR, PDGFR, VGFR, IGF-1R), tyrosine kinase inhibitors, MEK1/2, mTOR blockade and PI3K and HER2-neu pathway inhibitors. Only one trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and the PANTAR trial have demonstrated a survival improvement from EGFR inhibition using erlotinib. These trials ultimately led to FDA approval of erlotinib/Tarceva in advanced stage disease. It remains unclear whether new combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy plus molecular targeted therapy will be beneficial in management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Despite a number of phase II and III trials, to date, only erlotinib has emerged as an approved targeted therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There are several ongoing late phase trials evaluating a number of targets, the results of which will become available over the next 1 to 2 years.PMID: 27613576Title: Available technologies and clinical applications of targeted chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Mukherjee I, Powell B, Parianos M, Downs D, Ross SBSource: Cancer Genet. 2016 Aug 5. pii: S2210-7762(16)30225-3. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2016.08.001.Abstract: The incidence of pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer death in United States, is increasing worldwide. Even though the cure rate has doubled in 40 years, it is abysmally poor at 6-7%. As surgical resection remains the only curative treatment and less than 20% of the newly diagnosed cancers are resectable, the major burden of disease management lies in early diagnosis, good prognostication, and proper neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. With advancing technologies and their ease of availability, researchers have better tools to understand pancreatic cancer. In the post-genetic era, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, metabolomic, and more have brought us to a multi-omics era. These newer avenues bring promises of better screening modalities, less invasive diagnostics and monitoring, subtyping of pancreatic cancer, and fine tuning the treatment modalities not only to the right stage of tumor but also to the right tumor biology. As the multitudes of technologies are generating extensive amounts of incongruous data, they are giving clinicians a lot of non-actionable information. In this paper, we wish to encompass the newer technologies, sub-classifications, and future treatment modalities in personalized care of patients with pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27613553Title: Resection of the Primary Tumor Followed by Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy as Upfront Strategy for the Treatment of G1-G2 Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors with Unresectable Liver Metastases.Authors: Bertani E, Fazio N, Radice D, Zardini C, Grana C, Bodei L, Funicelli L, Ferrari C, Spada F, Partelli S, Falconi MSource: Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: BACKGROUND: A low burden of disease represents an independent favorable prognostic factor of response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients affected by gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, it is not clear whether this is due to a lower diffusion of the disease or thanks to debulking surgery. METHODS: From 1996 to 2013 those patients diagnosed with G1-G2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) and synchronous liver metastases who were not deemed eligible for liver radical surgery but were eligible to receive upfront PRRT were prospectively included in the study. Two groups of comparison were identified: those submitted for primary tumor resection before PRRT and those who were not. The outcome was evaluated as: objective response to PRRT (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 94 subjects, 31 were previously submitted for primary tumor resection. After propensity score adjustments, patients who underwent surgery before PRRT showed higher stabilization or objective responses after PRRT (p = .006), and this translated into a better median PFS (70 vs. 30 months; p = .002) and OS (112 vs. 65 months; p = .011), for operated versus nonoperated patients, respectively. At multivariate analysis, operated patients showed a statistically significantly improved PFS: HR, 5.11 (95 % CI 1.43-18.3); p = .012, whereas Ki-67 in continuous fashion was correlated significantly with OS: 1.13 (95 % CI 1-1.27); p = .048. CONCLUSIONS: Primary tumor resection prior to PRRT can be safely proposed in G1-G2 PNETs with diffuse liver metastases because it seems to enhance response to PRRT and to improve significantly PFS.PMID: 27613407Title: A potential role for CCN2/CTGF in aggressive colorectal cancer.Authors: Ubink I, Verhaar ER, Kranenburg O, Goldschmeding RSource: J Cell Commun Signal. 2016 Sep 10.Abstract: CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a transcriptional target of TGF-beta signaling. Unlike its original name ("CTGF") suggested, CCN2 is not an actual growth factor but a matricellular protein that plays an important role in fibrosis, inflammation and connective tissue remodeling in a variety of diseases, including cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, CCN2 signaling induces stromal infiltration and facilitates a strong tumor-stromal interaction. In many types of cancer, CCN2 overexpression has been associated with poor outcome. CMS4 (Consensus Molecular Subtype 4) is a recently identified aggressive colorectal cancer subtype, that is characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, TGF-beta signaling, angiogenesis, complement activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, a high influx of stromal fibroblasts contributes to the mesenchymal-like gene expression profile of this subtype. Furthermore, compared with the other three CMS groups, CMS4 tumors have the worst prognosis. Based on these observations, we postulated that CCN2 might contribute to colorectal cancer progression, especially in the CMS4 subtype. This review discusses the available literature on the role of CCN2 in colorectal cancer, with a focus on the 'fibrotic subtype' CMS4.PMID: 27612834Title: Unusual anti-leukemia activity of nanoformulated naproxen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Authors: Kumar R, Siril PF, Javid FSource: Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl. 2016 Dec 1;69:1335-44. doi: 10.1016/j.msec.2016.08.024. Epub 2016 Aug 9.Abstract: The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most widely used pharmaceuticals worldwide. Interestingly, many of them have significant anticancer properties too. However, the poor water solubility of certain NSAIDs limits their application for cancer treatment. Nanosizing of such drugs can help to improve the solubility and this may result in enhanced anticancer activities too. Moreover, over dosages and the accompanying side effects of NSAIDs can be minimized by improving their solubility and bioavailability. Successful nanoformulation of three NSAIDs: ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprufen (KP) and naproxen (NAP) using a novel evaporation assisted solvent-antisolvent interaction (EASAI) method is reported here. Three water soluble and biocompatible polymers: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were used to stabilize the drug nanoparticles. Particles having spherical morphology with average size below 30nm were thoroughly characterized using dynamic light scattering and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) imaging. The nanoformulation resulted in ten to fifteen fold improvements in the solubility and significant enhancement in the in-vitro drug release profiles of the NSAIDs. Anticancer screening of the nanoformulated NSAIDs against five different cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 (Human breast cancer cell line), (Human pancreatic cancer cell line) MIA-PA-CA-2, (Human colon cancer cell line) HT-29, (Human leukemia cell line) Jurkat and (human ovarian carcinoma cell line) A2780 was performed. All the nanoformulated samples showed improved anticancer activity against the Leukemia cancer cell line, out of which NAP-PVP showed the highest anti-cancer activity. The anti-Leukemia activity of NAP-PVP was more than twice that of doxorubicin which is a standard anticancer drug.PMID: 27611616Title: Invited Commentary: Pasireotide and the Prevention of Pancreatic Fistula After Pancreatectomy: "The Continued Search for Harry Potter's Liquid Luck".Authors: Yeo CJSource: Ann Surg. 2016 Sep 8.Abstract: ?PMID: 27610560Title: Probing the Diversity of T Cell Dysfunction in Cancer.Authors: Sowell RT, Kaech SMSource: Cell. 2016 Sep 8;166(6):1362-4. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.058.Abstract: T cell dysfunction in cancer comes in many forms, with two new varieties reported in this issue.

There are significant differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy and toxicity between pre- and post-nanovector modification. The alteration in clinical pharmacology is instrumental for the future development of nanovector-based anticancer therapeutics. We have reviewed the results of clinical studies and translational research in nanovector-based anti-cancer therapeutics in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and nanoliposomal irinotecan. Furthermore, we have appraised the ongoing studies incorporating novel agents with nanomedicines in the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.PMID: 27610015Title: Therapeutic potential of targeting acinar cell reprogramming in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Wong CH, Li YJ, Chen YCSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug 21;22(31):7046-57. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i31.7046.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a common pancreatic cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Treating this life-threatening disease remains challenging due to the lack of effective prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. Apart from pancreatic duct cells, acinar cells may also be the origin of PDAC. During pancreatitis or combined with activating KRas(G12D) mutation, acinar cells lose their cellular identity and undergo a transdifferentiation process called acinar-to-ductal-metaplasia (ADM), forming duct cells which may then transform into pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and eventually PDAC. During ADM, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Wnt, Notch and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/Akt signaling inhibits the transcription of acinar-specific genes, including Mist and amylase, but promotes the expression of ductal genes, such as cytokeratin-19. Inhibition of this transdifferentiation process hinders the development of PanIN and PDAC. In addition, the transdifferentiated cells regain acinar identity, indicating ADM may be a reversible process. This provides a new therapeutic direction in treating PDAC through cancer reprogramming. Many studies have already demonstrated the success of switching PanIN/PDAC back to normal cells through the use of PD325901, the expression of E47, and the knockdown of Dickkopf-3. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathways involved in ADM and the therapeutic potential of targeting reprogramming in order to treat PDAC.PMID: 27610011Title: FOLFIRINOX and translational studies: Towards personalized therapy in pancreatic cancer.Authors: Caparello C, Meijer LL, Garajova I, Falcone A, Le Large TY, Funel N, Kazemier G, Peters GJ, Vasile E, Giovannetti ESource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Aug 21;22(31):6987-7005. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i31.6987.Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is an extremely aggressive disease; although progress has been made in the last few years, the prognosis of these patients remains dismal. FOLFIRINOX is now considered a standard treatment in first-line setting, since it demonstrated an improved overall and progression-free survival vs gemcitabine alone. However, the enthusiasm over the benefit of this three-drug regimen is tempered by the associated increased toxicity profile, and many efforts have been made to improve the feasibility of this schedule. After a more recent phase III trial showing an improved outcome over gemcitabine, the combination of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel emerged as another standard first-line treatment. However, this treatment is also associated with more side effects. In addition, despite initial promising data on the predictive role of SPARC levels, recent studies showed that these levels are not associated with nab-paclitaxel efficacy. The choice to use this treatment over FOLFIRINOX is therefore a topic of debate, also because no validated biomarkers to guide FOLFIRINOX treatment are available. In the era of actionable mutations and target agents it would be desirable to identify molecular factors or biomarkers to predict response to therapy in order to maximize the efficacy of treatment and avoid useless toxic effects for non-responding patients. However, until today the milestone of treatment for pancreatic cancer remains chemotherapy combinations, without predictive or monitoring tools existing to optimize therapy. This review analyzes the state-of-the-art treatments, promises and limitations of targeted therapies, ongoing trials and future perspectives, including potential role of microRNAs as predictive biomarkers.PMID: 27609895Title: Tissue of origin dictates branched-chain amino acid metabolism in mutant Kras-driven cancers.Authors: Mayers JR, Torrence ME, Danai LV, Papagiannakopoulos T, Davidson SM, Bauer MR, Lau AN, Ji BW, Dixit PD, Hosios AM, Muir A, Chin CR, Freinkman E, Jacks T, Wolpin BM, Vitkup D, Vander Heiden MGSource: Science. 2016 Sep 9;353(6304):1161-5. doi: 10.1126/science.aaf5171.Abstract: Tumor genetics guides patient selection for many new therapies, and cell culture studies have demonstrated that specific mutations can promote metabolic phenotypes. However, whether tissue context defines cancer dependence on specific metabolic pathways is unknown. Kras activation and Trp53 deletion in the pancreas or the lung result in pancreatic ductal adenocarinoma (PDAC) or non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), respectively, but despite the same initiating events, these tumors use branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) differently. NSCLC tumors incorporate free BCAAs into tissue protein and use BCAAs as a nitrogen source, whereas PDAC tumors have decreased BCAA uptake. These differences are reflected in expression levels of BCAA catabolic enzymes in both mice and humans. Loss of Bcat1 and Bcat2, the enzymes responsible for BCAA use, impairs NSCLC tumor formation, but these enzymes are not required for PDAC tumor formation, arguing that tissue of origin is an important determinant of how cancers satisfy their metabolic requirements.PMID: 27609789Title: 68Ga/177Lu-NeoBOMB1, A Novel Radiolabeled GRPR Antagonist For Theranostic Use In Oncology.Authors: Dalm SU, Bakker IL, de Blois E, Doeswijk GN, Konijnenberg MW, Orlandi F, Barbato D, Tedesco M, Maina T, Nock BA, de Jong MSource: J Nucl Med. 2016 Sep 8. pii: jnumed.116.176636.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Since overexpression of the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has been reported on various cancer types, e.g. prostate cancer and breast cancer, targeting this receptor with radioligands might have significant impact on staging and treatment of GRPR-expressing tumors. NeoBOMB1 is a novel DOTA-coupled GRPR antagonist with high affinity for GRPR and excellent in vivo stability. The purpose of this preclinical study was to further explore the use of NeoBOMB1 for theranostic application by determining the biodistribution of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-3 tumor-xenografted Balb c nu/nu mice were injected with either ~13 MBq/250 pmol 68Ga-NeoBOMB1, or a low (~1 MBq/200 pmol) vs. high (~1 MBq/10 pmol) peptide amount of 177Lu-NeoBOMB1 after which biodistribution and imaging studies were performed. At 6 time points (15, 30, 60, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h for 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 1, 4, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h for 177Lu-NeoBOMB1) post injection (p.i.) tumor and organ uptake was determined. To assess receptor-specificity additional groups of animals were co-injected with an excess of unlabeled NeoBOMB1. Results of the biodistribution studies were used to determine pharmacokinetics and dosimetry. Furthermore, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and single photon emission computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (SPECT/MRI) was performed. RESULTS: Injection of ~250 pmol 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 resulted in a tumor and pancreas uptake of 12.4+/-2.3 and 22.7+/-3.3 %ID/g tissue 120 min p.i., respectively. 177Lu-NeoBOMB1 biodistribution studies revealed a higher tumor uptake (17.9+/-3.3 vs. 11.6+/-1.3 %ID/g tissue 4 h p.i.) and a lower pancreatic uptake (19.8+/-6.9 vs. 105+/-13 %ID/g tissue 4 h p.i.) with the higher peptide amount injected, leading to a significant increase in the absorbed dose to the tumor vs. the pancreas (200 pmol: 570 vs. 265 mGy/MBq, 10 pmol: 435 vs. 1393 mGy/MBq). Using this data to predict patient dosimetry we found a kidney, pancreas and liver exposure of 0.10, 0.65 and 0.06 mGy/MBq, respectively. Imaging studies resulted in good visualization of the tumor with both 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that 68Ga/177Lu-NeoBOMB1 is a very promising radiotracer with excellent tumor uptake and favorable pharmacokinetics for imaging and therapy of GRPR-expressing tumors.PMID: 27609579Title: [Knockdown of dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1) promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits the invasion and migration abilities of Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells].Authors: Bu X, Wang C, Jiang ZSource: Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Sep;32(9):1217-22.Abstract: Objective To investigate the impact of the decreased expression of dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1) on cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and migration of Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Methods After four pairs of DACH1 siRNA were designed and synthesized, double-stranded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were annealed and inserted into pGenesil-1 vector. The product was then confirmed by enzyme digestion and sequencing analysis. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into Capan-1 cells via Lipofectamine(TM) 2000. Fluorescence microscopy, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the transfection efficiency. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were tested by flow cytometry. Transwell(TM) assay was used to monitor the invasion and migration abilities of Capan-1 cells. Results Recombinant plasmid pshRNA-DACH1 was successfully constructed and transfected into Capan-1 cells. After transfection, the expression of DACH1 was reduced to some extent. Flow cytometry revealed that cell apoptosis was promoted in the pshRNA-DACH1 transfected group compared with control groups, whereas cell cycle had no significant differences among the groups. Transwell(TM) assay validated that the abilities of migration and invasion were inhibited in the pshRNA-DACH1 transfected group. Conclusion Knockdown of DACH1 expression can remarkably enhance the cell apoptosis, restrain the proliferation, migration and invasion of Capan-1 cells.PMID: 27609457Title: Honokiol Suppresses Pancreatic Tumor Growth, Metastasis and Desmoplasia by Interfering with Tumor-Stromal Cross-Talk.Authors: Averett C, Bhardwaj A, Arora S, Srivastava SK, Khan MA, Ahmad A, Singh S, Carter JE, Khushman M, Singh APSource: Carcinogenesis. 2016 Sep 8. pii: bgw096.Abstract: The poor clinical-outcome of pancreatic cancer (PC) is largely attributed to its aggressive nature and refractoriness to currently available therapeutic-modalities. We previously reported anti-tumor efficacy of Honokiol (HNK), a phytochemical isolated from various parts of Magnolia plant, against PC cells in short-term in-vitro growth assays. Here we report that HNK reduces plating-efficiency and anchorage-independent growth of PC cells and suppresses their migration and invasiveness. Furthermore, significant inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth by HNK is observed in orthotopic mouse model along with complete-blockage distant-metastases. Histological examination suggests reduced desmoplasia in tumors from HNK-treated mice, later confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of myofibroblasts- and extra-cellular-matrix marker proteins (alpha-SMA and Collagen-I, respectively). At the molecular level, HNK treatment, leads to decreased expression of SHH and CXCR4, two established mediators of bi-directional tumor-stromal cross-talk, both in-vitro and in-vivo We also show that the conditioned-media (CM) from HNK-treated PC cells has little growth-inducing effect on pancreatic-stellate cells (PSCs) that could be regained by addition of exogenous recombinant-SHH. Moreover, pre-treatment of CM of vehicle-treated PC cells with SHH-neutralizing antibody abolishes their growth-inducing potential on PSCs. Likewise, HNK-treated PC cells respond poorly to CM from PSCs due to decreased CXCR4 expression. Lastly, we show that the transfection of PC cells with constitutively-active IKKbeta-mutant reverses the suppressive effect of HNK on NF-kappaB activation, and partially restores CXCR4 and SHH expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that HNK interferes with tumor-stromal cross-talk via downregulation of CXCR4 and SHH and decreases pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis.PMID: 27609096Title: Paeoniflorin Potentiates the Inhibitory Effects of Erlotinib in Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines by Reducing ErbB3 Phosphorylation.Authors: Hao J, Yang X, Ding XL, Guo LM, Zhu CH, Ji W, Zhou T, Wu XZSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 9;6:32809. doi: 10.1038/srep32809.Abstract: Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors is insufficient for effective anti-tumor activity because the reactivation of the ErbB3 signaling pathway significantly contributes to activating the consequent phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Combinatorial therapies including ErbB3 targeting may ameliorate tumor responses to anti-EGFR therapies. In the present study, we found that in BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells, which highly expressed the ErbB3 receptor, significant reduction in cell viability, induction of apoptosis were observed when treated with a combination of erlotinib and PF compared to either agent alone. Moreover, in ErbB3-expressing BxPC-3, L3.6pl and S2VP10 cell lines, the inhibition of ErbB3/PI3K/Akt phosphorylation were observed when treated with PF. Most strikingly, both EGFR/MAPK/Erk and ErbB3/PI3K/Akt activitions were substantially suppressed when treated with the combination of PF and erlotinib. However, in the ErbB3-deficient cell line MIAPaCa-2, no such effects were observed with similar treatments. Most importantly, these in vitro results were replicated in nude mouse transplanted tumor models. Taken together, our findings show that PF enhances the effect of erlotinib in ErbB3-expressing pancreatic cancer cells by directly suppressing ErbB3 activation, and PF in combination with erlotinib is much more effective as an antitumor agent compared with either agent alone.PMID: 27609089Title: [Persistent elevation of Ca 19-9 and an unexpected finding. A case report].Authors: Souza-Gallardo LM, de la Fuente-Lira M, Galaso-Trujillo R, Martinez-Ordaz JLSource: Cir Cir. 2016 Sep 5. pii: S0009-7411(16)30057-3. doi: 10.1016/j.circir.2016.07.003.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumour markers are substances produced by the tumour itself, or by the host in response to a tumour. These markers could be measured either in the blood or in body secretions. One of the most common tumour markers used in gastrointestinal diseases is Ca 19-9. It is the marker most used for pancreatic cancer, but can be elevated in many benign processes. Thus, it is not a specific marker. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a male patient with 4 years of moderate abdominal pain, weight loss, and persistent elevation of Ca 19-9. After an extensive work-up, renal and hepatic cysts were found, as well as steatosis and, apparently, a gallbladder polyp. With these findings and the persistent elevation of Ca 19-9, it was decided to operate the patient. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed showing multiple, yellowish nodular lesions all over the hepatic surface suggestive of metastases, as well as simple hepatic cysts. Pathology reported biliary hamartomas, steatosis, and chronic cholecystitis. After 2years of follow up, although there is no evidence of malignant neoplasia, there is still an elevation of Ca 19-9. CONCLUSION: The persistent elevation of Ca 19-9 is probably due to the presence of multiple benign diseases such as steatosis, urolithiasis, hepatic and renal cysts, and cholecystitis. An algorithm is needed for healthy patients with elevated levels of Ca 19-9 marker, in order to lower costs, avoid misdiagnoses, and improve management.PMID: 27609088Title: [Extrahepatic and extrapulmonary hydatidosis].Authors: Adel F, Ramia JM, Gijon L, de la Plaza-Llamas R, Arteaga-Peralta V, Ramiro-Perez CSource: Cir Cir. 2016 Sep 5. pii: S0009-7411(16)30056-1. doi: 10.1016/j.circir.2016.07.002.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by larvae of the parasite Echinococcus that is endemic in many countries of the Mediterranean area. It can affect any organ, with the most common sites being liver (70%) and lung (20%). Splenic hydatid disease, despite being rare, is the third most common location. Other locations such as bone, skin, or kidney are exceptional. OBJECTIVE: To present our experience in extrahepatic and extrapulmonary hydatidosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Period: May 2007-December 2014. Health area: 251,000 inhabitants. During that period, a total of 136 patients with hydatid disease were evaluated in our Hepato-pancreatic-biliary Surgery Unit. Extrahepatic and extrapulmonary hydatid disease was found in 18 (13%) patients. A retrospective review was performed on all medical records, laboratory results, serology, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic measurements of all patients. An abdominal ultrasound and CT, as well as hydatid serology was also performed on all patients. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44.5 years, with a range of 33-80 years. Half the patients (50%) had concomitant hepatic echinococcosis. Of the 18 patients with hydatid disease, 13 underwent surgery (radical surgery in 12 cases), and one underwent (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)+puncture, aspiration, injection and re-aspiration. The remaining 4did not have surgery due to patient refusal (3), or advanced cancer (1). No recurrences have been observed. CONCLUSION: The best surgical treatment in these cases is closed total cystectomy to prevent recurrence, except in the spleen where splenectomy is preferred. Conservative techniques are indicated in cases of multiple hydatid disease and in patients with high surgical risk.PMID: 27608845Title: Sialylation transmogrifies human breast and pancreatic cancer cells into 3D multicellular tumor spheroids using cyclic RGD-peptide induced self-assembly.Authors: Akasov R, Haq S, Haxho F, Samuel V, Burov SV, Markvicheva E, Neufeld RJ, Szewczuk MRSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 6. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11868.Abstract: Multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) have been at the forefront of cancer research, designed to mimic tumor-like developmental patterns in vitro. Tumor growth in vivo is highly influenced by aberrant cell surface-specific sialoglycan structures on glycoproteins. Aberrant sialoglycan patterns that facilitate MTS formation are not well defined. Matrix-free spheroids from breast MCF-7 and pancreatic PANC1 cancer cell lines and their respective tamoxifen (TMX) and gemcitabine (Gem) resistant variants were generated using the RGD platform of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK (TPP)). MCF-7 and MCF-7 TMX cells formed tight spheroids both in the classical agarose- and RGD-based platforms while all PANC1 cells formed loose aggregates. Using lectin histochemistry staining, sialidase assay, neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) and oseltamivir phosphate (OP) neuraminidase inhibitor treatments, MCF-7 and PANC1 cells and their drug-resistant variants expressed different sialic acid (SA) content on their cell surfaces. alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-sialic acid surface residues facilitated spheroid formation under cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced self-assembly. Pretreatment with alpha-2,3-SA specific Maackia amurensis (MAL-II) lectin, alpha-2,6-SA specific Sambucus nigra (SNA) lectin, and exogenous alpha-2,6-SA specific neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) dose-dependently reduced spheroid volume. OP enhanced cell aggregation and compaction forming spheroids. PANC1 and MDA-MB231 xenograft tumors from untreated and OP-treated RAGxCgamma double mutant mice expressed significantly higher levels of alpha-2,3-SA over alpha-2,6-SA. MCF-7 spheroids also expressed a high alpha-2,3-SA to alpha-2,6-SA ratio. These results suggest that the relative levels of specific sialoglycan structures on the cell surface correlate with the ability of cancer cells to form avascular multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo xenograft tumors.PMID: 27608656Title: Identification of new chemical entities targeting APE1 for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).Authors: Kelley MR, Wikel JH, Guo C, Pollok KE, Bailey BJ, Wireman R, Fishel ML, Vasko MRSource: J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2016 Sep 8. pii: jpet.116.235283.Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a potentially debilitating side effect of a number of chemotherapeutic agents that does not have any FDA-approved interventions or prevention strategies. Although the cellular mechanisms mediating CIPN remain to be determined, several lines of evidence support the notion that DNA damage may be a causative factor in neuropathy induced by a number of cancer therapies. Therapies including platinum agents and ionizing radiation cause DNA damage in sensory neurons and augmenting key steps in the base excision repair (BER) pathway reverses this damage. Neuronal protection is provided by overexpressing APE1 as well as using a first generation targeted APE1 small molecule E3330 (also called APX3330). Accordingly, we determined whether novel second-generation APE1 targeted molecules would be protective against neurotoxicity-induced by cisplatin or oxaliplatin while not diminishing the anti-tumor effect of the platins. We determined using our ex vivo model of sensory neurons in culture measuring various endpoints of neurotoxicity that APX2009 is an effective small molecule that is neuroprotective against cisplatin and oxaliplatin-induced toxicity of sensory neurons. APX2009 also demonstrated a strong tumor cell killing effect in tumor cells. Additionally, the enhanced tumor cell killing was further shown in a more robust 3D pancreatic tumor model. Together, these data suggest that APX2009 is effective in preventing or reversing platinum-induced CIPN, while not affecting the anti-cancer activity of platins.PMID: 27608595Title: Clinical practice guidelines for prophylaxis of venous thomboembolism in cancer patients.Authors: Frere C, Farge DSource: Thromb Haemost. 2016 Aug 25;116(4).Abstract: Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs 4-7 times more frequently in cancer patients as compared to non-cancer patients. A significant number of risk factors, which can be subcategorised as patient-, cancer- or treatment-related, have been shown to influence the risk of VTE during malignancy and further incorporated in risk-assessment models. Safe and efficient thromboprophylaxis regimens allow substantial decreased in VTE rates, since VTE is most often a largely preventable disease, but thromboprophylaxis remains underused in cancer compared to non-cancer patients. If thromboprophylaxis is warranted in cancer patients undergoing surgery or hospitalised for acute medical illness or with a lower mobility in the absence of contraindications to anticoagulants, its benefit remains controversial in outpatients and may be limited to locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or lung cancer treated with chemotherapy. The International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer-CME free mobile app (ios and android), based on the International Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG), facilitates their implementation and dissemination of knowledge worldwide so as to improve VTE treatment and prophylaxis in cancer patients.PMID: 27608431Title: Functional Single-Chain Polymer Nanoparticles: Targeting and Imaging Pancreatic Tumors in vivo.Authors: Benito AB, Aiertza MK, Marradi M, Gil-Iceta L, Shekther Zahavi T, Szczupak B, Jimenez-Gonzalez M, Reese T, Scanziani E, Passoni L, Matteoli M, De Maglie M, Orenstein A, Oron-Herman M, Kostenich G, Buzhansky L, Gazit E, Grande HJ, Gomez-Vallejo V, Llop J, Loinaz ISource: Biomacromolecules. 2016 Sep 8.Abstract: The development of tools for the early diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an urgent need in order to increase treatment success rate and reduce patient mortality. Here, we present a modular nanosystem platform integrating soft nanoparticles with a targeting peptide and an active imaging agent for diagnostics. Biocompatible single-chain polymer nanoparticles (SCPNs) based on poly(methacrylic acid) were prepared and functionalized with the somatostatin analog PTR86 as the targeting moiety, since somatostatin receptors are over-expressed in pancreatic cancer. The gamma emitter 67Ga was incorporated by chelation and allowed in vivo investigation of the pharmacokinetic properties of the nanoparticles using Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT). The resulting engineered nanosystem was tested in a xenograph mouse model of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Imaging results demonstrate that accumulation of targeted SCPNs in the tumor is higher than that observed for non-targeted nanoparticles due to improved retention in this tissue.PMID: 27608045Title: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced CT in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Eriksen RO, Strauch LS, Sandgaard M, Kristensen TS, Nielsen MB, Lauridsen CASource: Diagnostics (Basel). 2016 Sep 6;6(3). pii: E34. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics6030034.Abstract: The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the use of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (DCE-CT) in patients with pancreatic cancer. This study was composed according to the PRISMA guidelines 2009. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify all relevant publications. The QUADAS-2 tool was implemented to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of each included study. The initial literature search yielded 483 publications. Thirteen articles were included. Articles were categorized into three groups: nine articles concerning primary diagnosis or staging, one article about tumor response to treatment, and three articles regarding scan techniques. In exocrine pancreatic tumors, measurements of blood flow in eight studies and blood volume in seven studies were significantly lower in tumor tissue, compared with measurements in pancreatic tissue outside of tumor, or normal pancreatic tissue in control groups of healthy volunteers. The studies were heterogeneous in the number of patients enrolled and scan protocols. Perfusion parameters measured and analyzed by DCE-CT might be useful in the investigation of characteristic vascular patterns of exocrine pancreatic tumors. Further clinical studies are desired for investigating the potential of DCE-CT in pancreatic tumors.PMID: 27607310Title: Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Time for a Randomized Controlled Trial?

Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a mass in the pancreas and multiple liver metastases. Pathological examination confirmed the mass to be primary pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic insertion of a biliary stent was performed to prevent common bile duct obstruction. Subsequently, she received combination chemotherapy, which resulted in a complete response. FDG-PET-CT after chemotherapy revealed a high uptake of FDG along the outline of the biliary stent, with complete disappearance of both the primary and metastatic tumors.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Overall, the GI cancers are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other organ. 5 year survival of these cancers remains low compared to western world. Unlike the rest of the world where organ based specialities hepatobiliary, pancreatic, colorectal and esophagogastric exist, these cancers are managed in India by either a gastrointestinal surgeons, surgical oncologist, or a general surgeon with varying outcomes. The aim of this review was to collate data on GI cancers in indian continent. In colorectal cancers, data from tertiary care centres identifies the unique problem of mucinous and signet colorectal cancer. Results of rectal cancer resection in terms of technique (intersphincteric resection, extralevator aper, minimal invasive approach) to be comparable with world literature. However long term outcome and data regarding colon cancers and nationally is needed. Gastric cancer at presentation are advanced and in surgically resected patients, there is need for a trial to compare chemoradiation vs chemotherapy alone to prevent loco regional recurrence. Data on minimal invasive gastric cancer surgery may be sparse for the same reason. Theree is a lot of data on surgical techniques and perioperatve outcomes in pancreatic cancer. There is a high volume of locally advanced gallbladder cancers with efforts on to decide whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is better for down staging. Considering GI cancers, a heterogeneous disease with site specific treatment options and variable outcomes, the overall data and outcomes are extremely variable. Young patients with pathology unique to the Indian subcontinent (for example, signet ring rectal cancer, GBCs) need focussed attention. Solution for such pathology needs to come from the Indian continent itself. Joint efforts to improve outcomes for GI cancer can be integrated under the national cancer grid program.PMID: 27605881Title: Enhanced recovery pathways in pancreatic surgery: State of the art.Authors: Pecorelli N, Nobile S, Partelli S, Cardinali L, Crippa S, Balzano G, Beretta L, Falconi MSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Jul 28;22(28):6456-68. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i28.6456.Abstract: Pancreatic surgery is being offered to an increasing number of patients every year. Although postoperative outcomes have significantly improved in the last decades, even in high-volume centers patients still experience significant postoperative morbidity and full recovery after surgery takes longer than we think. In recent years, enhanced recovery pathways incorporating a large number of evidence-based perioperative interventions have proved to be beneficial in terms of improved postoperative outcomes, and accelerated patient recovery in the context of gastrointestinal, genitourinary and orthopedic surgery. The role of these pathways for pancreatic surgery is still unclear as high-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking. To date, non-randomized studies have shown that care pathways for pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy are safe with no difference in postoperative morbidity, leading to early discharge and no increase in hospital readmissions. Hospital costs are reduced due to better organization of care and resource utilization. However, further research is needed to clarify the effect of enhanced recovery pathways on patient recovery and post-discharge outcomes following pancreatic resection. Future studies should be prospective and follow recent recommendations for the design and reporting of enhanced recovery pathways.PMID: 27605878Title: Re-evaluation of classical prognostic factors in resectable ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Authors: Akerberg D, Ansari D, Andersson RSource: World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Jul 28;22(28):6424-33. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i28.6424.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis with annual deaths almost matching the reported incidence rates. Surgical resection offers the only potential cure. Yet, even among patients that undergo tumor resection, recurrence rates are high and long-term survival is scarce. Various tumor-related factors have been identified as predictors of survival after potentially curative resection. These factors include tumor size, lymph node disease, tumor grade, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and surgical resection margin. This article will re-evaluate the importance of these factors based on recent publications on the topic, with potential implications for treatment and outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer.PMID: 27605668Title: Up-regulation of N-cadherin by Collagen I-activated Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 in Pancreatic Cancer Requires the Adaptor Molecule Shc1.Authors: Huang H, Svoboda RA, Lazenby AJ, Saowapa J, Chaika N, Ding K, Wheelock MJ, Johnson KRSource: J Biol Chem. 2016 Sep 7. pii: jbc.M116.740605.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are highly malignant cancers characterized by extensive invasion into surrounding tissues, metastasis to distant organs, and a limited response to therapy. A main feature of PDAC is desmoplasia, which leads to extensive deposition of collagen I. We have demonstrated that collagen I can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells. A hallmark of EMT is an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal cadherin N-cadherin. Previously we showed up-regulation of N-cadherin promotes tumor cell invasion and collagen I-induced EMT is mediated by two collagen receptors, alpha2beta1-integrin and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase widely expressed during embryonic development and in many adult tissues and is also highly expressed in many different cancers. In the signaling pathway initiated by collagen, we have shown Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is downstream of DDR1. In this study, we found isoform b of DDR1 is responsible for collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin and Tyrosine513 of DDR1b is necessary. Knocking down Shc1, which binds to Tyrosine513 of DDR1b via its PTB domain, eliminates the up-regulation of N-cadherin. The signaling does not require a functional SH2 domain or the Tyrosine residues commonly phosphorylated in Shc1 but is mediated by the interaction between a short segment of the central domain of Shc1 and the proline-rich region of Pyk2. Taken together, these data illustrate DDR1b, but not DDR1a, mediates collagen I-induced N-cadherin up-regulation and Shc1 is involved in this process by coupling to both DDR1 and Pyk2.PMID: 27605209Title: An innovative strategy for the identification and 3D reconstruction of pancreatic cancer from CT images.Authors: Marconi S, Pugliese L, Del Chiaro M, Pozzi Mucelli R, Auricchio F, Pietrabissa ASource: Updates Surg. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: We propose an innovative tool for Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma 3D reconstruction from Multi-Detector-Computed Tomography. The tumor mass is discriminated from health tissue, and the resulting segmentation labels are rendered preserving information on different hypodensity levels. The final 3D virtual model includes also pancreas and main peri-pancreatic vessels, and it is suitable for 3D printing. We performed a preliminary evaluation of the tool effectiveness presenting ten cases of Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma processed with the tool to an expert radiologist who can correct the result of the discrimination. In seven of ten cases, the 3D reconstruction is accepted without any modification, while in three cases, only 1.88, 5.13, and 5.70 %, respectively, of the segmentation labels are modified, preliminary proving the high effectiveness of the tool.PMID: 27605208Title: Are there still indications for total pancreatectomy?Authors: Del Chiaro M, Rangelova E, Segersvard R, Arnelo USource: Updates Surg. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: Total pancreatectomy is associated with short- and long-term high complication rate and without evidence of oncologic advantages. Several metabolic consequences are co-related with the apancreatic state. The unstable diabetes related to the total resection of the pancreas expose the patients to short- and long-term life-threatening complications. Severe hypoglycemia is a short-term dangerous complication that can also cause patients' death. Chronic complications of severe diabetes (cardiac and vascular diseases, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy) are also cause of morbidity, mortality and worsening of quality of life. For this reasons the number of total pancreatectomies performed has certainly decreased over time. However, today there are still some indications for this kind of procedures. Chronic pancreatitis untreatable with conventional treatments, surgical treatment of precancerous pancreatic lesions, surgical treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer and the management of patients with extraordinary high-risk pancreatic texture after pancreaticoduodenectomy represent possible indications for total pancreatectomy and are analyzed in the present paper.PMID: 27604902Title: TGF-beta-Induced Stromal CYR61 Promotes Resistance to Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Through Down-Regulation of the Nucleoside Transporters hENT1 and hCNT3.Authors: Hesler RA, Huang JJ, Starr MD, Treboschi VM, Bernanke AG, Nixon AB, McCall SJ, White RR, Blobe GCSource: Carcinogenesis. 2016 Sep 7. pii: bgw093.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer in part due to inherent resistance to chemotherapy, including the first-line drug gemcitabine. While low expression of the nucleoside transporters hENT1 and hCNT3 that mediate cellular uptake of gemcitabine has been linked to gemcitabine resistance, the mechanisms regulating their expression in the PDAC tumor microenvironment are largely unknown. Here, we report that the matricellular protein cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) negatively regulates the nucleoside transporters hENT1 and hCNT3. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CYR61 increased expression of hENT1 and hCNT3, increased cellular uptake of gemcitabine, and sensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. In PDAC patient samples, expression of hENT1 and hCNT3 negatively correlate with expression of CYR61 We demonstrate that stromal pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a source of CYR61 within the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces the expression of CYR61 in PSCs through canonical TGF-beta-ALK5-Smad2/3 signaling. Activation of TGF-beta signaling or expression of CYR61 in PSCs promotes resistance to gemcitabine in PDAC cells in an in vitro co-culture assay. Our results identify CYR61 as a TGF-beta-induced stromal-derived factor that regulates gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC and suggest that targeting CYR61 may improve chemotherapy response in PDAC patients.PMID: 27604886Title: Primary Tumor Resection Following Favorable Response to Systemic Chemotherapy in Stage IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Synchronous Metastases: a Bi-institutional Analysis.Authors: Wright GP, Poruk KE, Zenati MS, Steve J, Bahary N, Hogg ME, Zuriekat AH, Wolfgang CL, Zeh HJ 3rd, Weiss MJSource: J Gastrointest Surg. 2016 Sep 7.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma have traditionally been offered palliative chemotherapy alone, and the role of surgery in these patients remains unknown. METHODS: A bi-institutional retrospective review was performed for patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent resection of the primary tumor from 2008 to 2013. The primary outcome measured was postoperative overall survival. Secondary outcomes included postoperative disease-free survival and overall survival from the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified who met the study criteria with a median follow-up of 30 months. Metastatic sites included the liver (n = 16), the lung (n = 6), and the peritoneum (n = 2). Chemotherapy included FOLFIRINOX (n = 14) and gemcitabine-based regimens (n = 9), with a median of 9 cycles (range 2-31) prior to surgical treatment. Median time from diagnosis to surgery was 9.7 months (IQR 5.8-12.8). Median overall survival (OS) from surgery, disease-free survival, and OS from diagnosis were 18.2 months (95 % CI 11.8-35.5), 8.6 months (95 % CI 5.2-16.8), and 34.1 months (95 % CI 22.5-46.2), respectively. The 1- and 3-year OS from surgery were 72.7 % (95 % CI 49.1-86.7) and 21.5 % (95 % CI 4.3-47.2), respectively. CONCLUSION: Resection of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma may be considered in highly selected patients with favorable imaging and CA 19-9 response following chemotherapy at high-volume centers providing multidisciplinary care. These patients should be enrolled in prospective clinical trials or institutional registries to better quantify the potential benefits of such a strategy.PMID: 27604617Title: 12th WINFOCUS world congress on ultrasound in emergency and critical care.Authors: Acar Y, Tezel O, Salman N, Cevik E, Algaba-Montes M, Oviedo-Garcia A, Patricio-Bordomas M, Mahmoud MZ, Sulieman A, Ali A, Mustafa A, Abdelrahman I, Bahar M, Ali O, Lester Kirchner H, Prosen G, Anzic A, Leeson P, Bahreini M, Rasooli F, Hosseinnejad H, Blecher G, Meek R, Egerton-Warburton D, Cuti EC, Belina S, Vancina T, Kovacevic I, Rustemovic N, Chang I, Lee JH, Kwak YH, Kim do K, Cheng CY, Pan HY, Kung CT, Curcic E, Pritisanac E, Planinc I, Medic MG, Radonic R, Fasina A, Dean AJ, Panebianco NL, Henwood PS, Fochi O, Favarato M, Bonanomi E, Tomic I, Ha Y, Toh H, Harmon E, Chan W, Baston C, Morrison G, Shofer F, Hua A, Kim S, Tsung J, Gunaydin I, Kekec Z, Ay MO, Kim J, Kim J, Choi G, Shim D, Lee JH, Ambrozic J, Prokselj K, Lucovnik M, Simenc GB, Maciuliene A, Maleckas A, Krisciukaitis A, Maciulis V, Macas A, Mohite S, Narancsik Z, Mozina H, Nikolic S, Hansel J, Petrovcic R, Mrsic U, Orlob S, Lerchbaumer M, Schonegger N, Kaufmann R, Pan CI, Wu CH, Pasquale S, Doniger SJ, Yellin S, Chiricolo G, Potisek M, Drnovsek B, Leskovar B, Robinson K, Kraft C, Moser B, Davis S, Layman S, Sayeed Y, Minardi J, Pasic IS, Dzananovic A, Pasic A, Zubovic SV, Hauptman AG, Brajkovic AV, Babel J, Peklic M, Radonic V, Bielen L, Ming PW, Yezid NH, Mohammed FL, Huda ZA, Ismail WN, Isa WY, Fauzi H, Seeva P, Mazlan MZSource: Crit Ultrasound J. 2016 Sep;8(Suppl 1):12. doi: 10.1186/s13089-016-0046-8.Abstract: TABLE OF CONTENTS: A1 Point-of-care ultrasound examination of cervical spine in emergency departmentYahya Acar, Onur Tezel, Necati SalmanA2 A new technique in verifying the placement of a nasogastric tube: obtaining the longitudinal view of nasogastric tube in addition to transverse view with ultrasoundYahya Acar, Necati Salman, Onur Tezel, Erdem CevikA3 Pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery after cannulation of a central venous line.

Physiologically, TRPM7 channel is involved in magnesium homeostasis, cell survival and gastrulation. The channel part is responsible for calcium, magnesium, and metal trace entries. Cation current through TRPM7 channel is inhibited by both intracellular magnesium and magnesium complexed with nucleotides. In parallel, the kinase is able to phosphorylate cytoskeleton proteins like myosin chain regulating cell tension and motility. Moreover, TRPM7 kinase domain can be cleaved by caspase and participates to apoptosis signaling. Importantly, TRPM7 channel expression is aberrant in numerous cancers including breast, glioblastoma, nasopharynx, ovarian, and pancreatic. Moreover, TRPM7 high expression is an independent biomarker of poor outcome in breast cancer. Pharmacological modulation or silencing of TRPM7 strongly affects proliferation, adhesion, migration or invasion in cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, it is still not clear by which mechanism TRPM7 channels may disturb cancer cell hallmarks. In the present review, we will discuss the role of TRPM7 channels in malignancies. In particular, we will distinguish the role of cation signaling from kinase function in order to better understand how TRPM7 channels may play a central role in cancer progression. We will also discuss the recent advances in pharmacological blockers of TRPM7 and their potential use for cancer therapy.PMID: 27604035Title: Ablation of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer with Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation: Results of the Phase I/II PANFIRE Study.Authors: Scheffer HJ, Vroomen LG, de Jong MC, Melenhorst MC, Zonderhuis BM, Daams F, Vogel JA, Besselink MG, van Kuijk C, Witvliet J, de van der Schueren MA, de Gruijl TD, Stam AG, van den Tol PM, van Delft F, Kazemier G, Meijerink MRSource: Radiology. 2016 Sep 6:152835.Abstract: Purpose To (a) investigate the safety of percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and (b) evaluate the quality of life (QOL), pain perception, and efficacy in terms of time to local progression, event-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local review board (NL42888.029.13). All patients provided written informed consent for study participation, the ablation procedure, and data usage. Between January 2014 and June 2015, 25 patients with histologically proved locally advanced pancreatic cancer 5 cm or smaller (13 women, 12 men; median age, 61 years; age range, 41-78 years) were prospectively included to undergo percutaneous computed tomographic-guided IRE. Patients with a metallic biliary Wallstent, epilepsy, or ventricular arrhythmias were excluded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to investigate time to local progression, event-free survival, and OS. Safety was assessed on the basis of adverse events, which were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Pain perception and QOL were evaluated by using specific questionnaires. Results All patients underwent IRE. The median largest tumor diameter was 4.0 cm (range, 3.3-5.0 cm). After a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range: 7-16 months), median event-free survival after IRE was 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 months, 12 months); the median time to local progression after IRE was 12 months (95% CI: 8 months, 16 months). The median OS was 11 months from IRE (95% CI: 9 months, 13 months) and 17 months from diagnosis (95% CI: 10 months, 24 months). There were 12 minor complications (grade I or II) and 11 major complications (nine grade III, two grade IV) in 10 patients. There were no deaths within 90 days after IRE. Conclusion Percutaneous IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer is generally well tolerated, although major adverse events can occur. Preliminary survival data are encouraging and support the setup of larger phase II and III clinical trials to assess the efficacy of IRE plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant or second-line setting compared with more widely adopted regimens such as chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

ACC caused by a BRCA2 mutation has never been reported. METHODS: Nucleotide sequencing of BRCA2 in lymphocyte and tumoral DNA of a 50-year-old male who presented with an androgen-secreting ACC and a strong family history of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. RESULTS: A germline BRCA2 2 bp heterozygous deletion at nucleotide 8765 (8765delAG) leading to a frameshift mutation (p.Glu2846GlyfsX23) was detected. Only the BRCA2 deleted allele was retained in the ACC tumoral DNA compared with the control DNA supporting a loss of heterozygosity in the tumor. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a patient with ACC associated with a BRCA2 germline mutation. Loss of heterozygosity in ACC DNA suggests a causal link with the BRCA2 8765delAG mutation.PMID: 27602953Title: Mertk on tumor macrophages is a therapeutic target to prevent tumor recurrence following radiation therapy.Authors: Crittenden MR, Baird J, Friedman D, Savage T, Uhde L, Alice A, Cottam B, Young K, Newell P, Nguyen C, Bambina S, Kramer G, Akporiaye E, Malecka A, Jackson A, Gough MJSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 2. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11823.Abstract: Radiation therapy provides a means to kill large numbers of cancer cells in a controlled location resulting in the release of tumor-specific antigens and endogenous adjuvants. However, by activating pathways involved in apoptotic cell recognition and phagocytosis, irradiated cancer cells engender suppressive phenotypes in macrophages. We demonstrate that the macrophage-specific phagocytic receptor, Mertk is upregulated in macrophages in the tumor following radiation therapy. Ligation of Mertk on macrophages results in anti-inflammatory cytokine responses via NF-kB p50 upregulation, which in turn limits tumor control following radiation therapy. We demonstrate that in immunogenic tumors, loss of Mertk is sufficient to permit tumor cure following radiation therapy. However, in poorly immunogenic tumors, TGFbeta inhibition is also required to result in tumor cure following radiation therapy. These data demonstrate that Mertk is a highly specific target whose absence permits tumor control in combination with radiation therapy.PMID: 27602925Title: No Difference in Overall Survival Between Hospital Volumes for Patients With Colorectal Cancer in The Netherlands.Authors: Bos AC, van Erning FN, Elferink MA, Rutten HJ, van Oijen MG, de Wilt JH, Lemmens VESource: Dis Colon Rectum. 2016 Oct;59(10):943-52. doi: 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000660.Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-volume hospitals have been associated with improved patient outcomes for tumors with a relatively low incidence that require complex surgeries, such as esophageal and pancreatic cancer. The volume-outcome association for colorectal cancer is under debate. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether hospital volume for colorectal cancer is associated with surgical care characteristics and 5-year overall survival. DESIGN: This is a population-based study. SETTING: Data were gathered from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Hospitals were grouped by volume for colon (<50, 50-74, 75-99, and >/=100 resections per year) and rectum (<20, 20-39, and >/=40 resections per year). PATIENTS: All of the patients with primary nonmetastatic colorectal cancer who underwent resection between 2005 and 2012 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in surgical approach, anastomotic leakage, and postoperative 30-day mortality between hospital volumes were analyzed using chi tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of hospital volume on overall survival. RESULTS: This study included 61,394 patients with colorectal cancer. In 2012, 31 of the 91 hospitals performed less than 50 colon cancer resections per year, and 21 of the 90 hospitals performed less than 20 rectal cancer resections per year. No differences in anastomotic leakage rates between hospital volumes were observed. Only small differences between hospital volumes were revealed for conversion of laparoscopic to open resection (OR of less than 50 versus 100 or more resections per year = 1.25 (95% CI, 1.06-1.46)) and postoperative 30-day mortality (colon: OR of less than 50 versus 100 or more resections per year = 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02-1.35); rectum: OR of less than 20 versus 40 or more resections per year = 1.42 (95% CI, 1.09-1.84)). No differences in overall survival were found between hospital volumes. LIMITATIONS: Although we adjusted for several patient and tumour characteristics, data regarding comorbidity, surgeon volume, local recurrences, and specific postoperative complications other than anastomotic leakage were not available. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, no differences in 5-year survival rates were revealed between hospital volumes for patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer.PMID: 27602776Title: A novel method for RNA extraction from FFPE samples reveals significant differences in biomarker expression between orthotopic and subcutaneous pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenografts.Authors: Hoover M, Adamian Y, Brown M, Maawy A, Chang A, Lee J, Gharibi A, Katz MH, Fleming J, Hoffman RM, Bouvet M, Doebler R, Kelber JASource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11809.Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify and validate new biomarkers of cancer onset, progression and therapy resistance. Substantial archives of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples from patients represent a rich resource for linking molecular signatures to clinical data. However, performing NGS on FFPE samples is limited by poor RNA purification methods. To address this hurdle, we developed an improved methodology for extracting high-quality RNA from FFPE samples. By briefly integrating a newly-designed micro-homogenizing (mH) tool with commercially available FFPE RNA extraction protocols, RNA recovery is increased by approximately 3-fold while maintaining standard A260/A280 ratios and RNA quality index (RQI) values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mH-purified FFPE RNAs are longer and of higher integrity. Previous studies have suggested that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) gene expression signatures vary significantly under in vitro versus in vivo and in vivo subcutaneous versus orthotopic conditions. By using our improved mH-based method, we were able to preserve established expression patterns of KRas-dependency genes within these three unique microenvironments. Finally, expression analysis of novel biomarkers in KRas mutant PDAC samples revealed that PEAK1 decreases and MST1R increases by over 100-fold in orthotopic versus subcutaneous microenvironments. Interestingly, however, only PEAK1 levels remain elevated in orthotopically grown KRas wild-type PDAC cells. These results demonstrate the critical nature of the orthotopic tumor microenvironment when evaluating the clinical relevance of new biomarkers in cells or patient-derived samples. Furthermore, this new mH-based FFPE RNA extraction method has the potential to enhance and expand future FFPE-RNA-NGS cancer biomarker studies.PMID: 27602757Title: Pancreatic stellate cell secreted IL-6 stimulates STAT3 dependent invasiveness of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells.Authors: Nagathihalli NS, Castellanos JA, VanSaun MN, Dai X, Ambrose M, Guo Q, Xiong Y, Merchant NBSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11786.Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dynamic tumor supported by several stromal elements such as pancreatic stellate cells (PSC). Significant crosstalk exists between PSCs and tumor cells to stimulate oncogenic signaling and malignant progression of PDAC. However, how PSCs activate intercellular signaling in PDAC cells remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is a key component in the progression of pancreatic neoplasia. We hypothesize that PSC secreted IL-6 activates STAT3 signaling to promote PanIN progression to PDAC. Human PDAC and mouse PanIN cells were treated with PSC-conditioned media (PSC-CM), and phospho- and total-STAT3 levels by immunoblot analysis were determined. IL-6 was quantified in PSC-CM and cell invasion and colony formation assays were performed in the presence or absence of a neutralizing IL-6 antibody and the JAK/STAT3 inhibitor AZD1480. Serum from Ptf1aCre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox (PKT) and LSL-KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1Cre/+ (KPC) mice demonstrated increased levels of IL-6 compared to serum from non-PDAC bearing KC and PK mice. PSC secreted IL-6 activated STAT3 signaling in noninvasive, precursor PanIN cells as well as PDAC cells, resulting in enhanced cell invasion and colony formation in both cell types. There was a significant positive linear correlation between IL-6 concentration and the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3/total STAT3. IL-6 neutralization or STAT3 inhibition attenuated PSC-CM induced activation of STAT3 signaling and tumorigenicity. These data provide evidence that PSCs are directly involved in promoting the progression of PanINs towards invasive carcinoma. This study demonstrates a novel role of PSC secreted IL-6 in transitioning noninvasive pancreatic precursor cells into invasive PDAC through the activation of STAT3 signaling.PMID: 27602756Title: Comparison of efficacy in adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with radically resected gastric cancer : a propensity-matched analysis.Authors: Quan R, Huang J, Chen H, Liao Y, Lv W, Chen N, Liu J, Zhang H, Xu DSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11783.Abstract: BACKGROUND: We conducted the retrospective study to compare the efficacy of monotherapies versus two-drug regimens as postoperative chemotherapy for patients with radically resected gastric cancer. RESULT: At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, no significant difference in terms of OS was observed between two groups, neither before nor after matching. After matching, median DFS was statistically significant between group A and B (median, 67.5 vs 101.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.95; P=0.027), which meant doublets prolonged DFS. In subgroup analysis, the patients of stage III receiving doublet achieved better OS than those receiving monotherapy. People who received doublet and were less than 65 years old, or male patients, or in T4 stage, or in N2 stage, or receiving subtotal gastrectomy had better DFS than those with monotherapy. METHOD: A data set including 501 patients (monotherapy, n=107; doublet, n=394) was matched between the two groups (n=107 patients per group) using the propensity-matched study. The primary and secondary endpoint was overall survival(OS) and disease-free survival(DFS), respectively. Survival data was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportion hazards models for univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: The dual regimens seemed not to add overall survival benefits to patients receiving curative gastrectomy, compared with single-agent fluoropyrimidine as postoperative chemotherapy. However, dual regimens showed better disease-free survival.PMID: 27602753Title: Gemcitabine promotes immune escape of pancreatic cancer by down regulating the soluble ULBP2 protein.Authors: Lin X, Huang M, Xie F, Zhou H, Yang J, Huang QSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11780.Abstract: Due to early onset of local invasion and distant metastasis, pancreatic cancer is the most lethal human malignant tumor, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 5%. As a effective chemotherapy drug for pancreatic cancer patients, gemcitabine is reported to inhibit cell proliferation as a nucleotide analog. In this study, we investigated the role of gemcitabine in immune regulation of pancreatic cancer. Our data showed that the level of soluble ULBP2 (sULBP2), a ligand of NKG2D receptor, decreased in the supernatants of pancreatic cancer cell lines when gemcitabine was added, and sULBP2 level correlated with NK92 cells cytotoxicity to pancreatic cancer cell lines. Importantly, our data showed that gemcitabine promoted PANC-1 cells and MIA PaCa-2 immune evasion by reducing ADAM10 expression, a metalloproteinase involved in sULBP2 shedding from cell membrane. Knockdown of ADAM10 clearly downregulated sULBP2 levels in the culture supernatants and cells became more susceptible to NK92 cytotoxicity. Serum samples and tumor samples were obtained from 45 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between the serum level of sULBP2 with ADAM10 expression in PDAC tissues. In conclusion, our data demostrated that gemcitabine inhibits ULBP2 ectodomain shedding through the suppression of ADAM10 and enhance NK cells cytotoxicity by NKG2D-ULBP2 interaction. The results extends our understanding of gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer from cell proliferation inhibition to immune regulation.PMID: 27602750Title: Expression of truncated bile salt-dependent lipase variant in pancreatic pre-neoplastic lesions.Authors: Martinez E, Crenon I, Silvy F, Del Grande J, Mougel A, Barea D, Fina F, Bernard JP, Ouaissi M, Lombardo D, Mas ESource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 1. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11777.Abstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dismal disease. The lack of specific symptoms still leads to a delay in diagnosis followed by death within months for most patients. Exon 11 of the bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) gene encoding variable number of tandem repeated (VNTR) sequences has been involved in pancreatic pathologies. We hypothesized that BSDL VNTR sequences may be mutated in PDAC. The amplification of BSDL VNTR from RNA extracted from pancreatic SOJ-6 cells allowed us to identify a BSDL amplicon in which a cytosine residue is inserted in a VNTR sequence. This insertion gives rise to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein and to a modification of the C-terminal amino-acid sequence; that is PRAAHG instead of PAVIRF. We produced antibodies directed against these sequences and examined pancreatic tissues from patients with PDAC and PanIN. Albeit all tissues were positive to anti-PAVIRF antibodies, 72.2% of patient tissues gave positive reaction with anti-PRAAHG antibodies, particularly in dysplastic areas of the tumor. Neoplastic cells with ductal differentiation were not reactive to anti-PRAAHG antibodies. Some 70% of PanIN tissues were also reactive to anti-PRAAHG antibodies, suggesting that the C insertion occurs early during pancreatic carcinogenesis. Data suggest that anti-PRAAHG antibodies were uniquely reactive with a short isoform of BSDL specifically expressed in pre-neoplastic lesions of the pancreas. The detection of truncated BSDL reactive to antibodies against the PRAAHG C-terminal sequence in pancreatic juice or in pancreatic biopsies may be a new tool in the early diagnosis of PDAC.PMID: 27602498Title: Quantification of nucleic acid quality in postmortem tissues from a cancer research autopsy program.Authors: Fan J, Khanin R, Sakamoto H, Zhong Y, Michael C, Pena D, Javier B, Wood LD, Iacobuzio-Donahue CASource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 2. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11836.Abstract: The last decade has seen a marked rise in the use of cancer tissues obtained from research autopsies. Such resources have been invaluable for studying cancer evolution or the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. Degradation of biomolecules is a potential challenge to usage of cancer tissues obtained in the post-mortem setting and remains incompletely studied. We analysed the nucleic acid quality in 371 different frozen tissue samples collected from 80 patients who underwent a research autopsy, including eight normal tissue types, primary and metastatic tumors. Our results indicate that RNA integrity number (RIN) of normal tissues decline with the elongation of post-mortem interval (PMI) in a tissue-type specific manner. Unlike normal tissues, the RNA quality of cancer tissues is highly variable with respect to post-mortem interval. The kinetics of DNA damage also has tissue type-specific features. Moreover, while DNA degradation is an indicator of low RNA quality, the converse is not true. Finally, we show that despite RIN values as low as 5.0, robust data can be obtained by RNA sequencing that reliably discriminates expression signatures.PMID: 27602165Title: APC promoter is frequently methylated in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic carcinomas or periampullary tumors.Authors: Ginesta MM, Diaz-Riascos ZV, Busquets J, Pelaez N, Serrano T, Peinado MA, Jorba R, Garcia-Borobia FJ, Capella G, Fabregat JSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):2210-2216. Epub 2016 Jul 15.Abstract: Early detection of pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms is critical to improve their clinical outcome. The present authors previously demonstrated that DNA hypermethylation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), histamine receptor H2 (HRH2), cadherin 13 (CDH13), secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC) and engrailed-1 (EN-1) promoters is frequently detected in pancreatic tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to assess their prevalence in pancreatic juice of carcinomas of the pancreas and periampullary area. A total of 135 pancreatic juices obtained from 85 pancreatic cancer (PC), 26 ampullary carcinoma (AC), 10 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and 14 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients were analyzed. The methylation status of the APC, HRH2, CDH13, SPARC and EN-1 promoters was analyzed using methylation specific-melting curve analysis (MS-MCA). Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations were also tested with allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification. Out of the 5 promoters analyzed, APC (71%) and HRH2 (65%) were the most frequently methylated in PC juice. APC methylation was also detected at a high frequency in AC (76%) and IPMN (80%), but only occasionally observed in CP (7%). APC methylation had a high sensitivity (71-80%) for all types of cancer analyzed. The panel (where a sample scored as positive when >/=2 markers were methylated) did not outperform APC as a single marker. Finally, KRAS detection in pancreatic juice offered a lower sensitivity (50%) and specificity (71%) for detection of any cancer. APC hypermethylation in pancreatic juice, as assessed by MS-MCA, is a frequent event of potential clinical usefulness in the diagnosis of pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms.PMID: 27602113Title: Effect of MUC1/beta-catenin interaction on the tumorigenic capacity of pancreatic CD133+ cells.Authors: Sousa AM, Rei M, Freitas R, Ricardo S, Caffrey T, David L, Almeida R, Hollingsworth MA, Santos-Silva FSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):1811-1817. Epub 2016 Jul 20.Abstract: Despite the fact that the biological function of cluster of differentiation (CD)133 remains unclear, this glycoprotein is currently used in the identification and isolation of tumor-initiating cells from certain malignant tumors, including pancreatic cancer. In the present study, the involvement of mucin 1 (MUC1) in the signaling pathways of a highly tumorigenic CD133+ cellular subpopulation sorted from the pancreatic cancer cell line HPAF-II was evaluated. The expression of MUC1-cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) and oncogenic signaling transducers (epidermal growth factor receptor, protein kinase C delta, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), as well as the association between MUC1 and beta-catenin, were characterized in HPAF-II CD133+ and CD133low cell subpopulations and in tumor xenografts generated from these cells. Compared with HPAF CD133low cells, HPAF-II CD133+ cancer cells exhibited increased tumorigenic potential in immunocompromised mice, which was associated with overexpression of MUC1 and with the accordingly altered expression profile of MUC1-associated signaling partners. Additionally, MUC1-CD/beta-catenin interactions were increased both in the HPAF-II CD133+ cell subpopulation and derived tumor xenografts compared with HPAF CD133low cells. These results suggest that, in comparison with HPAF CD133low cells, CD133+ cells exhibit higher expression of MUC1, which contributes to their tumorigenic phenotype through increased interaction between MUC1-CD and beta-catenin, which in turn modulates oncogenic signaling cascades.PMID: 27602112Title: Localized 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at the pancreatic head during remission phase of autoimmune pancreatitis: A case report.Authors: Yonenaga Y, Kushihata F, Watanabe J, Tohyama T, Inoue H, Sugita A, Takada YSource: Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):1801-1805. Epub 2016 Jul 6.Abstract: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of pancreatitis, histopathologically characterized by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis of the pancreas with obliterative phlebitis. AIP is associated with a good response to steroid therapy. Differentiation between AIP and pancreatic cancer to determine a preoperative diagnosis is often challenging, despite the use of various diagnostic modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. It has been reported that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be a useful tool for distinguishing between the two diseases. In the present case report, a 71-year-old male patient presented with a well-circumscribed, solitary, nodular and homogenous 18F-FDG uptake at the pancreatic head, while receiving maintenance steroid therapy in the remission phase of AIP; preoperatively, the patient had been strongly suspected of having pancreatic cancer. Pathological examination revealed post-treatment relapse of AIP. The present case highlights the diagnostic and management difficulties with AIP in the remission phase. In certain cases, it remains challenging to differentiate the two diseases, even using the latest modalities.PMID: 27601652Title: Actinomycin D enhances killing of cancer cells by immunotoxin RG7787 through activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.Authors: Liu XF, Xiang L, Zhou Q, Carralot JP, Prunotto M, Niederfellner G, Pastan ISource: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 20;113(38):10666-10671. Epub 2016 Sep 6.Abstract: RG7787 is a mesothelin-targeted immunotoxin designed to have low-immunogenicity, high-cytotoxic activity and fewer side effects. RG7787 kills many types of mesothelin-expressing cancer cells lines and causes tumor regressions in mice. Safety and immunogenicity of RG7787 is now being assessed in a phase I trial. To enhance the antitumor activity of RG7787, we screened for clinically used drugs that can synergize with RG7787. Actinomycin D is a potent transcription inhibitor that is used for treating several cancers. We report here that actinomycin D and RG7787 act synergistically to kill many mesothelin-positive cancer cell lines and produce major regressions of pancreatic and stomach cancer xenografts. Analyses of RNA expression show that RG7787 or actinomycin D alone and together increase levels of TNF/TNFR family members and NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Western blots revealed the combination changed apoptotic protein levels and enhanced cleavage of Caspases and PARP.PMID: 27601510Title: Public Reporting of Hospital-Level Cancer Surgical Volumes in California: An Opportunity to Inform Decision Making and Improve Quality.Authors: Clarke CA, Asch SM, Baker L, Bilimoria K, Dudley RA, Fong N, Holliday-Hanson ML, Hopkins DS, Imholz EM, Malin J, Moy L, O'Sullivan M, Parker JP, Saigal CS, Spurlock B, Teleki S, Zingmond D, Lang LSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep 6. pii: JOPR010819.Abstract: PURPOSE: Most patients, providers, and payers make decisions about cancer hospitals without any objective data regarding quality or outcomes. We developed two online resources allowing users to search and compare timely data regarding hospital cancer surgery volumes. METHODS: Hospital cancer surgery volumes for all California hospitals were calculated using ICD-9 coded hospital discharge summary data. Cancer surgeries included (bladder, brain, breast, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, and stomach) were selected on the basis of a rigorous literature review to confirm sufficient evidence of a positive association between volume and mortality. The literature could not identify threshold numbers of surgeries associated with better or worse outcomes. A multidisciplinary working group oversaw the project and ensured sound methodology. RESULTS: In California in 2014, about 60% of surgeries were performed at top-quintile-volume hospitals, but the per-hospital median numbers of surgeries for esophageal, pancreatic, stomach, liver, or bladder cancer surgeries were four or fewer. At least 670 patients received cancer surgery at hospitals that performed only one or two surgeries for a particular cancer type; 72% of those patients lived within 50 miles of a top-quintile-volume hospital. CONCLUSION: There is clear potential for more readily available information about hospital volumes to help patient, providers, and payers choose cancer surgery hospitals. Our successful public reporting of hospital volumes in California represents an important first step toward making publicly available even more provider-specific data regarding cancer care quality, costs, and outcomes, so those data can inform decision-making and encourage quality improvement.PMID: 27601469Title: Molecular basis for recognition of the cancer glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc(beta1-4)GlcNAc) by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin.Authors: Haji-Ghassemi O, Gilbert M, Spence J, Schur MJ, Parker MJ, Jenkins ML, Burke JE, van Faassen H, Young NM, Evans SVSource: J Biol Chem. 2016 Sep 6. pii: jbc.M116.750463.Abstract: Aberrant glycosylation and the overexpression of specific carbohydrate epitopes is a hallmark of many cancers, and tumor-associated oligo-saccharides are actively investigated as targets for immunotherapy and diagnostics. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) is a legume lectin that recognizes terminal N-acetylgalactosaminides with high affinity. WFA preferentially binds the disaccharide LacdiNAc (beta-D-GalNAc-[1-->4]-D-GlcNAc), which is associated with tumor malignancy in leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers, and has shown promise in cancer glycobiomarker detection. The mechanism of specificity for WFA recognition of LacdiNAc is not fully understood. To address this problem, we have determined affinities and structure of WFA in complex with GalNAc and LacdiNAc. Affinities towards Gal, GalNAc, and LacdiNAc were measured via surface plasmon resonance, yielding KD values of 4.67 x 10-4 M, 9.24 x 10-5 M, and 5.45 x 10-6 M respectively. Structures of WFA in complex with LacdiNAc and GalNAc have been determined to 1.80 A - 2.32 A resolution. These high-resolution structures revealed a hydrophobic groove complementary to the GalNAc and, to a minor extent, to the backface of the GlcNAc sugar ring. Remarkably, the contribution of this small hydrophobic surface significantly increases the observed affinity for LacdiNAc over GalNAc. Tandem MS sequencing confirmed presence of two isolectin forms in commercially available WFA differing only in the identities of two amino acids. Finally, the WFA carbohydrate binding site is similar to a homologous lectin isolated from Vatairea macrocarpa in complex with GalNAc which, unlike WFA, binds not only alphaGalNAc but also terminal Ser/Thr O-linked alphaGalNAc (Tn antigen).PMID: 27601467Title: Ewing Tumor-Associated Antigen 1 Interacts with Replication Protein A to Promote Restart of Stalled Replication Forks.Authors: Feng S, Zhao Y, Xu Y, Ning S, Hou W, Hou M, Gao G, Ji J, Guo R, Xu DSource: J Biol Chem. 2016 Sep 6. pii: jbc.C116.747758.Abstract: The replication protein A (RPA) complex binds single-stranded DNA generated at stalled replication forks and recruits other DNA repair proteins to promote recovery of these forks. Here we identify Ewing Tumor-Associated Antigen 1 (ETAA1), which has been linked to susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, as a new repair protein that is recruited to stalled forks by RPA. We demonstrate that ETAA1 interacts with RPA through two regions, each of which resembles to previously identified RPA-binding domains: RPA70N-binding motif and RPA32C-binding motif, respectively. In response to replication stress, ETAA1 is recruited to stalled forks where it colocalizes with RPA; and this recruitment is diminished when RPA is depleted. Notably, inactivation of ETAA1 gene increases the collapse level of the stalled replication forks and decreased the recovery efficiency of these forks. Moreover, epistasis analysis shows that ETAA1 stabilizes stalled replication forks in an ATR-independent manner. Thus, our results reveal that ETAA1 is a novel RPA-interacting protein that promotes restart of stalled replication forks.PMID: 27601260Title: A practical approach to liver metastasis from unknown primary cancer: What surgeons need to know.Authors: Swaid F, Downs D, Rosemurgy ASSource: Cancer Genet. 2016 Aug 15. pii: S2210-7762(16)30228-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2016.08.004.Abstract: The liver is a site of metastasis in 25% of metastatic cancers (Abbruzzese et al., 1995). In Western countries, metastases are the most common type of malignant neoplasms in the liver. The majority of liver metastases arise from carcinomas, but other primary tumor types should also be considered, such as lymphomas, sarcomas, melanomas, and germ cell tumors. Of primary liver malignancies, hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common (Hertz et al., 2000). The differentiation between metastatic carcinoma to the liver and primary hepatocellular carcinoma is sometimes challenging. In the last decade, newer technologies have emerged and are being used to reinforce the existing traditional pathologic staining and immunohistochemistry techniques, thus increasing the accuracy of primary site detection, and suggesting new targeted treatment options. The purpose of this review is to present and summarize, in a practical and simplified manner, the current literature regarding the clinically challenging entity of liver metastasis from carcinomas of unknown primary.PMID: 27601235Title: Novel epi-virotherapeutic treatment of pancreatic cancer combining the oral histone deacetylase inhibitor resminostat with oncolytic measles vaccine virus.Authors: Ellerhoff TP, Berchtold S, Venturelli S, Burkard M, Smirnow I, Wulff T, Lauer UMSource: Int J Oncol. 2016 Aug 31. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3675.Abstract: Oncolytic viruses (OV) constitute highly promising innovative biological anticancer agents. However, like every other antitumoral compound, OV are also faced with both primary and secondary mechanisms of resistance. To overcome those barriers and moreover amplify the therapeutic potential of OV, we evaluated a novel combined approach composed of the oral histone deacetylase inhibitor resminostat and an oncolytic measles vaccine virus (MeV) for a future epivirotherapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that combined epi-virotherapeutic treatment of four well-characterized human pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in a beneficial tumor cell killing as compared to either monotherapeutic approach. Notably, epi-virotherapeutic treatment of MIA PaCa-2 and partly also of PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells resulted in a tumor cell mass reduction being significantly more pronounced than it would be expected in case of an additive effect only, indicating a synergistic mode of action when combining resminostat with MeV. We further found that the epigenetic compound resminostat neither impaired MeV growth kinetics nor prevented the activation of the interferon signaling pathway which plays an important role in mediating primary and secondary resistances to OV. Moreover, we yielded information that the pharma-codynamic function of resminostat was presumably not altered in the course of pancreatic cancer cell infections with MeV. Taken together, these promising results favor the onset of epi-viro-thera-peutic clinical trials in patients suffering from advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.PMID: 27600995Title: Significance of baseline and change in quality of life scores in predicting clinical outcomes in an international phase III trial of advanced pancreatic cancer: NCIC CTG PA.3.Authors: Vickers MM, Lee C, Tu D, Wheatley-Price P, Parulekar W, Brundage MD, Moore MJ, Au H, O'Callaghan CJ, Jonker DJ, Ringash J, Goldstein DSource: Pancreatology. 2016 Aug 30. pii: S1424-3903(16)31181-4. doi: 10.1016/j.pan.2016.08.013.Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is insufficient information regarding the prognostic significance of baseline and change in quality of life (QoL) scores on overall survival (OS) in advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: QoL was assessed prospectively using the EORTC QLQ-C30 as part of the PA.3 trial of gemcitabine + erlotinib (G + E) vs. gemcitabine + placebo (G + P). Relevant variables and QoL scores at baseline and change at 8 weeks were analyzed by Cox stepwise regression to determine predictors of OS. RESULTS: 222 of 285 patients (pts) treated with G + E and 220 of 284 pts treated with G + P completed baseline QoL assessments. In a multivariable Cox analysis combining all pts, better QoL physical functioning (PF) score independently predicted longer OS (HR 0.86; CI: 0.80-0.93), as did non-white race (HR 0.64; CI: 0.44-0.95), PS 0-1 (HR 0.65; CI: 0.50-0.85), locally advanced disease (HR 0.55; CI: 0.43-0.71) and G + E (HR 0.78; CI: 0.64-0.96). Improvement in physical function at week 8 also predicted for improved survival (HR 0.89; CI: 0.81-0.97 for 10 point increase in score, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In addition to clinical variables, patient reported QoL scores at baseline and change from baseline to week 8 added incremental predictive information regarding survival for advanced pancreatic cancer patients.
