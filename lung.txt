PMID: 27652207Title: Integrative physicians and an herbal cancer "cure".Authors: Ben-Arye E, Rosenberg SK, Samuels NSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):443-445.Abstract: Oncologists are frequently asked about herbal remedies claiming to "cure" cancer, or at least delay its progression. While complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) should be aimed primarily at improving quality-of-life (QOL) related concerns, "wonder cures" are part of an alternative health belief model providing hope for a "miracle" where conventional treatment has failed. We describe a physician with extensive small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing chemotherapy, with significant toxicities and impaired daily function. He had come for an integrative physician (IP) consultation, provided by a medical doctor dually trained in CIM and supportive cancer care, taking place in a conventional supportive cancer care service. We describe the IP consultation in general and regarding an herbal remedy which was being promoted as a "cure" for cancer. The subsequent patient-tailored CIM treatment process, in which patients receive evidence-based guidance on treatments which address QOL-related concerns, are presented.PMID: 27652206Title: Prognostic value of wingless-type proteins in non-small cell lung cancer patients: a meta-analysis.Authors: Jin J, Zhan P, Qian H, Wang X, Katoh M, Phan K, Chung JH, Lv T, Song YSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):436-442.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Wingless-type protein (Wnt) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of human malignancies, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Several studies have shown that the expression levels of Wnt proteins, ligands of Wnt signaling pathway, are related to clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of Wnts proteins in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: A multiple electronic literature search was conducted to identify all articles referring to the prognostic value of Wnt proteins in patients of NSCLC up to July 2016. Eligible studies were included in a meta-analysis in order to summarize the extracted data in terms of pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Ten studies published between 2005 and 2015 were eligible for this meta-analysis. The total number of patients included was 1,805. The combined HR for all eligible studies evaluating the overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients with positive Wnt expression was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.39-1.84). The subgroup analysis showed both Wnt1 and Wnt5a are associated with clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of Wnt proteins, as well as Wnt1 or Wnt5a alone, was markedly associated with adverse OS in lung cancer patients, suggesting that Wnts may act as a prognostic marker among NSCLCs.PMID: 27652205Title: S100B and S100B autoantibody as biomarkers for early detection of brain metastases in lung cancer.Authors: Choi H, Puvenna V, Brennan C, Mahmoud S, Wang XF, Phillips M, Janigro D, Mazzone PSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):413-419.Abstract: BACKGROUND: S100B is an astrocytic protein that enters the blood stream when there is disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Over time, antibodies against S100B develop in the sera of patients who experience persistent or repeated BBB disruptions. We explored the use of serum S100B protein and S100B autoantibodies for the detection of brain metastasis in patients with lung cancer. METHODS: One hundred and twenty eight untreated patients with lung cancer who had brain imaging performed as part of their routine evaluation, participated. Serum S100B protein levels were measured by direct ELISA and S100B autoantibody levels by reverse ELISA. These levels in patients with brain metastases were compared alone and in combination to those without brain metastases. RESULTS: Eighteen (14%) patients had brain metastasis at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. An S100B cutoff of 0.058 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 43% for brain metastasis. When an autoantibody threshold of <2.00 absorbance units was used in conjunction with S100B, the sensitivity remained at 89%, and the specificity increased to 58%. The overall accuracy was 51% with S100B alone, improving to 62.5% when combined with autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S100B and S100B autoantibody levels may help to identify which lung cancer patients have brain metastases.PMID: 27652204Title: Histopathological transformation to small-cell lung carcinoma in non-small cell lung carcinoma tumors.Authors: Dorantes-Heredia R, Ruiz-Morales JM, Cano-Garcia FSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):401-412.Abstract: Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The use of targeted therapies, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), in specific groups of patients has dramatically improved the prognosis of this disease, although inevitably some patients will develop resistance to these drugs during active treatment. The most common cancer-associated acquired mutation is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Thr790Met (T790M) mutation. During active treatment with targeted therapies, histopathological transformation to small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can occur in 3-15% of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors. By definition, SCLC is a high-grade tumor with specific histological and genetic characteristics. In the majority of cases, a good-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is enough to establish a diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other neoplasia such as sarcomatoid carcinomas, large-cell carcinoma, basaloid squamous-cell carcinoma, chronic inflammation, malignant melanoma, metastatic carcinoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma. A loss of the tumor-suppressor protein retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) is found in 100% of human SCLC tumors; therefore, it has an essential role in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Other genetic pathways probably involved in the histopathological transformation include neurogenic locus notch homolog (NOTCH) and achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1). Histological transformation to SCLC can be suspected in NSCLC patients who clinically deteriorate during active treatment. Biopsy of any new lesion in this clinical setting is highly recommended to rule out a SCLC transformation. New studies are trying to assess this histological transformation by noninvasive measures such as measuring the concentration of serum neuron-specific enolase.PMID: 27652203Title: Targeting angiogenesis in small cell lung cancer.Authors: Stratigos M, Matikas A, Voutsina A, Mavroudis D, Georgoulias VSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):389-400.Abstract: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy. Despite high initial response rates to systemic chemotherapy, the disease eventually relapses; further treatment only modestly improves outcomes and overall survival (OS) for patients with extensive stage disease is less than one year. Little progress has been made during the past decades, with no new drugs approved. Consequently, the development of novel strategies is an unmet need. The inhibition of angiogenesis, a defining characteristic of cancer, has demonstrated modest efficacy in several human malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, results from clinical trials in SCLC have been disappointing, and no anti-angiogenic agent has received regulatory approval due to lack of clinical efficacy. The elucidation of underlying mechanisms responsible for tumor resistance to angiogenic therapy and the simultaneous blockade of multiple elements that play a role in angiogenesis need to be further explored.PMID: 27652202Title: From diagnosis to therapy in lung cancer: management of CT detected pulmonary nodules, a summary of the 2015 Chinese-German Lung Cancer Expert Panel.Authors: Su C, Meyer M, Pirker R, Voigt W, Shi J, Pilz L, Huber RM, Wu Y, Wang J, He Y, Wang X, Zhang J, Zhi X, Shi M, Zhu B, Schoenberg SS, Henzler T, Manegold C, Zhou C, Roessner EDSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):377-388.Abstract: The first Chinese-German Lung Cancer Expert Panel was held in November 2015 one day after the 7th Chinese-German Lung Cancer Forum, Shanghai. The intention of the meeting was to discuss strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer within the context of lung cancer screening. Improved risk classification criteria and novel imaging approaches for screening populations are highly required as more than half of lung cancer cases are false positive during the initial screening round if the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demographic criteria [>/=30 pack years (PY) of cigarettes, age >/=55 years] are applied. Moreover, if the NLST criteria are applied to the Chinese population a high number of lung cancer patients are not diagnosed due to non-smoking related risk factors in China. The primary goal in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules (PN) is to determine whether they are malignant or benign. Volumetric based screening concepts such as investigated in the Dutch-Belgian randomized lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) seem to achieve higher specificity. Chest CT is the best imaging technique to identify the origin and location of the nodule since 20% of suspected PN found on chest X-ray turn out to be non-pulmonary lesions. Moreover, novel state-of-the-art CT systems can reduce the radiation dose for lung cancer screening acquisitions down to a level of 0.1 mSv with improved image quality to novel reconstruction techniques and thus reduce concerns related to chest CT as the primary screening technology. The aim of the first part of this manuscript was to summarize the current status of novel diagnostic techniques used for lung cancer screening and minimally invasive treatment techniques for progressive PNs that were discussed during the first Chinese-German Lung Cancer. This part should serve as an educational part for the readership of the techniques that were discussed during the Expert Panel. The second part summarizes the consensus recommendations that were interdisciplinary discussed by the Expert Panel.PMID: 27652201Title: Improved overall survival following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment in NSCLC-are we making progress?Authors: Fenchel K, Dale SP, Dempke WCSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):373-376.Abstract: ?PMID: 27652079Title: Risk of spontaneous pneumothorax due to air travel and diving in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.Authors: Johannesma PC, van de Beek I, van der Wel JW, Paul MA, Houweling AC, Jonker MA, van Waesberghe JH, Reinhard R, Starink TM, van Moorselaar RJ, Menko FH, Postmus PESource: Springerplus. 2016 Sep 7;5(1):1506. eCollection 2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skin fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax and renal cell cancer due to germline folliculin (FLCN) mutations (Menko et al. in Lancet Oncol 10(12):1199-1206, 2009). The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with BHD during or shortly after air travel and diving. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to a cohort of 190 BHD patients and the medical files of these patients were evaluated. The diagnosis of BHD was confirmed by FLCN mutations analysis in all patients. We assessed how many spontaneous pneumothoraces (SP) occurred within 1 month after air travel or diving. RESULTS: In total 158 (83.2 %) patients returned the completed questionnaire. A total of 145 patients had a history of air travel. Sixty-one of them had a history of SP (42.1 %), with a mean of 2.48 episodes (range 1-10). Twenty-four (35.8 %) patients had a history of pneumothorax on both sides. Thirteen patients developed SP < 1 month after air travel (9.0 %) and two patients developed a SP < 1 month after diving (3.7 %). We found in this population of BHD patients a pneumothorax risk of 0.63 % per flight and a risk of 0.33 % per episode of diving. Symptoms possible related to SP were perceived in 30 patients (20.7 %) after air travel, respectively in ten patients (18.5 %) after diving. CONCLUSION: Based on the results presented in this retrospective study, exposure of BHD patients to considerable changes in atmospheric pressure associated with flying and diving may be related to an increased risk for developing a symptomatic pneumothorax. Symptoms reported during or shortly after flying and diving might be related to the early phase of pneumothorax. An individualized advice should be given, taking also into account patients' preferences and needs.PMID: 27651941Title: Translational research in thoracic surgery-the National Taiwan University Hospital experience.Authors: Lin MW, Yang PW, Lee JMSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S642-S647.Abstract: Thoracic surgeons should be more aware of the latest information about histopathological, genetic and epigenetic alterations that may influence treatment policy and patient outcome in the biomolecular era. Translational research studies often produce a promising diagnostic tool or new treatment that can be used clinically. The results of these translational studies may even change the practical guidelines and current staging system in thoracic malignancies. The following article summarizes the experiences of translational research in esophageal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan.PMID: 27651937Title: Recent clinical innovations in thoracic surgery in Hong Kong.Authors: Zhao ZR, Li Z, Situ DR, Ng CSSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S618-S626.Abstract: The concept of personalized medicine, which aims to provide patients with targeted therapies while greatly reducing surgical trauma, is gaining popularity among Asian clinicians. Single port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has rapidly gained popularity in Hong Kong for major lung resections, despite bringing new challenges such as interference between surgical instruments and insertion of the optical source through a single incision. Novel types of endocutters and thoracoscopes can help reduce the difficulties commonly encountered during single-port VATS. Our region has been the testing ground and has led the development of many of these innovations. Performing VATS, in particular single-port VATS in hybrid operating theatre helps to localise small pulmonary lesions with real-time images, thus increasing surgical accuracy and pushes the boundaries in treating subcentimeter diseases. Such approach may be assisted by use of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy in the same setting. In addition, sublobar resection can also be more individualised according to pathologic tumour subtype that require rapid intraoperative diagnostic test to guide appropriate surgical therapy. A focus on technology and innovation for large tumours that require chest wall resection and reconstructions have also been on going, with new materials and prostheses that may be tailored to each individual needs. The current paper reviews the literature pertaining to the above topics and discusses recent related innovations in Hong Kong, highlighting the study results and future perspectives.PMID: 27651936Title: Clinical innovations in Philippine thoracic surgery.Authors: Danguilan JLSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S613-S617.Abstract: Thoracic surgery in the Philippines followed the development of thoracic surgery in the United States and Europe. With better understanding of the physiology of the open chest and refinements in thoracic anesthetic and surgical approaches, Filipino surgeons began performing thoracoplasties, then lung resections for pulmonary tuberculosis and later for lung cancer in specialty hospitals dealing with pulmonary diseases-first at the Quezon Institute (QI) and presently at the Lung Center of the Philippines although some university and private hospitals made occasional forays into the chest. Esophageal surgery began its early attempts during the post-World War II era at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), a university hospital affiliated with the University of the Philippines. With the introduction of minimally invasive thoracic surgical approaches, Filipino thoracic surgeons have managed to keep up with their Asian counterparts although the problems of financial reimbursement typical of a developing country remain. The need for creative innovative approaches of a focused multidisciplinary team will advance the boundaries of thoracic surgery in the Philippines.PMID: 27651935Title: Asian perspectives in thoracic surgery: clinical innovation in Taiwan.Authors: Liu CY, Lin CS, Liu CCSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S606-S612.Abstract: The development of minimally-invasive surgery of the thorax began in the 1990s, but not until the recent decade did we see dramatic improvements in patient care and refinement of technique. The current generation has witnessed the evolution from traditional thoracotomy, to a single-port, non-intubated thoracoscopic approach. The investigation of subxiphoid single-port, transumbilical approach, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) in animal model are also undergoing. In Taiwan, several talented young surgeons have vigorously devoted their ideas and innovations to this field, making the Taiwan surgical society vivid and prosperous. The desire to improve, and willingness to change are the foundation of those surgeons. Providing better patient care is their impetus to strive for improvement. This article provides an account of how minimally-invasive thoracic surgery has evolved in recent years, and what clinical innovations have been developed by the Taiwan surgical society.PMID: 27651934Title: Asian perspective in surgery: thoracic surgery in Turkey.Authors: Turna ASource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S601-S605.Abstract: Turkey with a population of 78 million is located between Asia and Europe geographically and culturally. There are 577 active pure thoracic surgeon and 37 thoracic surgery teaching units. Thoracic surgeons usually deal with lung cancer patients due to relatively higher rate of tobacco usage as well as inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary hydatid disease, bronchiectasis and empyema. Minimally invasive thoracic surgery has been a new approach which is being adapted by increasingly more surgeons. There are a number of reasons to predict that the number of thoracic surgical cases will be increased and new generation of thoracic surgeons will be operating more minimally invasive resectional surgeries for most lung cancer in future.PMID: 27651933Title: Thoracic surgery in India: challenges and opportunities.Authors: Yendamuri SSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S596-S600.Abstract: India has the dubitable honor of being ranked first in the world with regards to lung disease burden. A good proportion of this disease burden is amenable to surgical treatment. However, patients have limited access to quality thoracic surgical care due to a number of obstacles. This review article summarizes these obstacles and the implied opportunities that exist in this nascent surgical discipline in the world's second most populous country.PMID: 27651932Title: Trends and current status of general thoracic surgery in Japan revealed by review of nationwide databases.Authors: Okumura MSource: J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(Suppl 8):S589-S595.Abstract: Nationwide databases of cases treated for thoracic disease have been established by several academic associations in Japan, which contain information showing trends and current status in regard to surgical treatment. The Japanese Association of Thoracic Surgery (JATS), Japanese Association of Chest Surgery (JACS), Japan Lung Cancer Society (JLCS), Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and Japan Society for Respiratory Endoscopy (JSRE) have maintained databases of lung cancer cases treated in Japan. In 1986, the number of general thoracic surgery cases was 15,544, which increased to 75,306 in 2013. Furthermore, the number of lung cancer operations performed in 2013 was 37,008, occupying 49.1% of all general thoracic operations. Also, the proportions of adenocarcinoma, female patients, aged patients, stage I disease, and limited resection procedures are increasing in lung cancer surgery cases. While the 5-year overall post-operative survival rate of lung cancer patients was 47.8% in those undergoing surgery in 1989, it was 69.6% in those of 2004, which means 22% increase during 15 years. JATS, JACS, and the Japanese Association for Research of the Thymus (JART) have maintained retrospective databases of thymic epithelial tumor cases. The number of mediastinal tumors surgically treated is also increasing and was 4,780 in 2013, among which thymoma was the most prevalent. The Japanese Association for Lung and Heart-Lung Transplantation has developed a prospective nationwide database of lung transplantation cases in Japan, which contains clinical data for 466 patients who received lung transplantation or heart-lung transplantation from 1998 to 2015. Nationwide databases are currently being utilized for clinical studies and will also contribute to international projects related to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) classification system.PMID: 27651818Title: Gigantol Inhibits Epithelial to Mesenchymal Process in Human Lung Cancer Cells.Authors: Unahabhokha T, Chanvorachote P, Sritularak B, Kitsongsermthon J, Pongrakhananon VSource: Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2016;2016:4561674. Epub 2016 Aug 29.Abstract: Lung cancer remains a leading public health problem as evidenced by its increasing death rate. The main cause of death in lung cancer patients is cancer metastasis. The metastatic behavior of lung cancer cells becomes enhanced when cancer cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Gigantol, a bibenzyl compound extracted from the Thai orchid, Dendrobium draconis, has been shown to have promising therapeutic potential against cancer cells, which leads to the hypothesis that gigantol may be able to inhibit the fundamental EMT process in cancer cells. This study has demonstrated for the first time that gigantol possesses the ability to suppress EMT in non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells. Western blot analysis has revealed that gigantol attenuates the activity of ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (AKT), thereby inhibiting the expression of the major EMT transcription factor, Slug, by both decreasing its transcription and increasing its degradation. The inhibitory effects of gigantol on EMT result in a decrease in the level of migration in H460 lung cancer cells. The results of this study emphasize the potential of gigantol for further development against lung cancer metastasis.PMID: 27651747Title: Disseminated Skeletal Muscle and Cardiac Metastasis from Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung Detected with FDG and FLT PET/CT.Authors: Jain TK, Rayamajhi SJ, Basher RK, Gupta D, Maturu VN, Mittal BRSource: World J Nucl Med. 2016 Sep;15(3):215-217.Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the leading cancers all over the world. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18F FDG) is useful for staging of the disease and decide the appropriate management. 3'-deoxy-3'-18 F-fluorothymidine (18F FLT) is a tracer being extensively evaluated currently and is said to represent tumor proliferation. Common sites of metastases from lung cancer include adrenal glands, bone, and brain. Muscle metastasis and cardiac metastasis are uncommon findings. We report a case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with metastases to multiple skeletal muscles and myocardium detected with both FDG and FLT PET/computed tomography (CT).PMID: 27651515Title: Variations in GPs' decisions to investigate suspected lung cancer: a factorial experiment using multimedia vignettes.Authors: Sheringham J, Sequeira R, Myles J, Hamilton W, McDonnell J, Offman J, Duffy S, Raine RSource: BMJ Qual Saf. 2016 Sep 20. pii: bmjqs-2016-005679. doi: 10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005679.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer survival is low and comparatively poor in the UK. Patients with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer commonly consult primary care, but it is unclear how general practitioners (GPs) distinguish which patients require further investigation. This study examined how patients' clinical and sociodemographic characteristics influence GPs' decisions to initiate lung cancer investigations. METHODS: A factorial experiment was conducted among a national sample of 227 English GPs using vignettes presented as simulated consultations. A multimedia-interactive website simulated key features of consultations using actors ('patients'). GP participants made management decisions online for six 'patients', whose sociodemographic characteristics systematically varied across three levels of cancer risk. In low-risk vignettes, investigation (ie, chest X-ray ordered, computerised tomography scan or respiratory consultant referral) was not indicated; in medium-risk vignettes, investigation could be appropriate; in high-risk vignettes, investigation was definitely indicated. Each 'patient' had two lung cancer-related symptoms: one volunteered and another elicited if GPs asked. Variations in investigation likelihood were examined using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: GPs decided to investigate lung cancer in 74% (1000/1348) of vignettes. Investigation likelihood did not increase with cancer risk. Investigations were more likely when GPs requested information on symptoms that 'patients' had but did not volunteer (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.18; 95% CI 2.27 to 4.70). However, GPs omitted to seek this information in 42% (570/1348) of cases. GPs were less likely to investigate older than younger 'patients' (AOR=0.52; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.7) and black 'patients' than white (AOR=0.68; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: GPs were not more likely to investigate 'patients' with high-risk than low-risk cancer symptoms. Furthermore, they did not investigate everyone with the same symptoms equally. Insufficient data gathering could be responsible for missed opportunities in diagnosis.PMID: 27651479Title: Cancer incidence and mortality from exposure to radon progeny among Ontario uranium miners.Authors: Navaranjan G, Berriault C, Do M, Villeneuve PJ, Demers PASource: Occup Environ Med. 2016 Sep 20. pii: oemed-2016-103836. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2016-103836.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to extend the follow-up of the Ontario uranium miners cohort, one of the largest cohorts of uranium miners with low cumulative exposures, to examine the relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality and, for the first time incidence, and address gaps in the literature, including dose-response relationship between radon exposure and other cancer sites, and non-cancer mortality. METHODS: The cohort of mine and mill workers was created using data from Canada's National Dose Registry and the Ontario Mining Master File. The follow-up for the cohort was recently extended for mortality (1954-2007) and for the first time includes cancer incidence (1969-2005). The Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and excess relative risks (ERR) and their 95% CIs with levels of cumulative radon exposure. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 28 546 male miners with a mean cumulative radon exposure of 21.0 working level months (WLM). An increased risk of lung cancer and a dose-response relationship was observed with cumulative radon exposure. Miners exposed to >100 WLM demonstrated a twofold increase in the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR=1.89, CI 1.43 to 2.50) compared with the non-exposed group, and a linear ERR of 0.64/100 WLM (CI 0.43 to 0.85), with similar results observed for mortality. No association was observed for other cancer sites (stomach, leukaemia, kidney and extrathoracic airways) or non-cancer sites (cardiovascular diseases) with increasing cumulative exposure to radon. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest no increased risk of cancer sites other than lung or non-cancer mortality from relatively low cumulative exposure to radon.PMID: 27651444Title: Epigenetic Signatures of Cigarette Smoking.Authors: Joehanes R, Just AC, Marioni RE, Pilling LC, Reynolds LM, Mandaviya PR, Guan W, Xu T, Elks CE, Aslibekyan S, Moreno-Macias H, Smith JA, Brody JA, Dhingra R, Yousefi P, Pankow JS, Kunze S, Shah S, McRae AF, Lohman K, Sha J, Absher DM, Ferrucci L, Zhao W, Demerath EW, Bressler J, Grove ML, Huan T, Liu C, Mendelson MM, Yao C, Kiel DP, Peters A, Wang-Sattler R, Visscher PM, Wray NR, Starr JM, Ding J, Rodriguez CJ, Wareham NJ, Irvin MR, Zhi D, Barrdahl M, Vineis P, Ambatipudi S, Uitterlinden AG, Hofman A, Schwartz J, Colicino E, Hou L, Vokonas PS, Hernandez DG, Singleton AB, Bandinelli S, Turner ST, Ware EB, Smith AK, Klengel T, Binder EB, Psaty BM, Taylor KD, Gharib SA, Swenson BR, Liang L, DeMeo DL, O'Connor GT, Herceg Z, Ressler KJ, Conneely KN, Sotoodehnia N, Kardia SL, Melzer D, Baccarelli AA, van Meurs JB, Romieu I, Arnett DK, Ong KK, Liu Y, Waldenberger M, Deary IJ, Fornage M, Levy D, London SJSource: Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2016 Sep 20. pii: CIRCGENETICS.116.001506.Abstract: BACKGROUND: -DNA methylation leaves a long-term signature of smoking exposure and is one potential mechanism by which tobacco exposure predisposes to adverse health outcomes, such as cancers, osteoporosis, lung, and cardiovascular disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: -To comprehensively determine the association between cigarette smoking and DNA methylation, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation assessed using the Illumina BeadChip 450K array on 15,907 blood derived DNA samples from participants in 16 cohorts (including 2,433 current, 6,518 former, and 6,956 never smokers). Comparing current versus never smokers, 2,623 CpG sites (CpGs), annotated to 1,405 genes, were statistically significantly differentially methylated at Bonferroni threshold of p<1x10-7 (18,760 CpGs at False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05). Genes annotated to these CpGs were enriched for associations with several smoking-related traits in genome-wide studies including pulmonary function, cancers, inflammatory diseases and heart disease. Comparing former versus never smokers, 185 of the CpGs that differed between current and never smokers were significant p<1x10-7 (2,623 CpGs at FDR<0.05), indicating a pattern of persistent altered methylation, with attenuation, after smoking cessation. Transcriptomic integration identified effects on gene expression at many differentially methylated CpGs. CONCLUSIONS: -Cigarette smoking has a broad impact on genome-wide methylation that, at many loci, persists many years after smoking cessation. Many of the differentially methylated genes were novel genes with respect to biologic effects of smoking, and might represent therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Methylation at these sites could also serve as sensitive and stable biomarkers of lifetime exposure to tobacco smoke.PMID: 27651378Title: Reduced expression of EphA5 is associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma.Authors: Gu S, Feng J, Jin Q, Wang W, Zhang SSource: Histol Histopathol. 2016 Sep 21:11815.Abstract: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The prognosis of patients has improved markedly over the last 15 years because of the introduction of new therapy including molecular target drugs. To comprehensively understand the molecular process of carcinogenesis of colorectal carcinoma is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. EphA5 is a member of the Eph family and plays a critical role in carcinogenesis of lung cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. The expression profile and the role of EphA5 in colorectal carcinoma have not been well investigated till now. In this study, a set of colorectal carcinoma specimens was subjected to immunohistochemical assay using an EphA5 specific antibody. The relationship between the expression of EphA5 and clinicopathological parameters was statistically analyzed. EphA5 was positively expressed in all tested normal mucosa specimens (120/120, 100%) and partly in colorectal carcinoma specimens (70/120, 58.3%). The loss of EphA5 protein was associated with depth of wall invasion (P=0.002), poor tumor differentiation (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), and advanced TNM stage (P<0.001). The survival analysis showed that patients with reduced expression of EphA5 had a poor overall survival (P=0.017). Our data indicate that EphA5 receptor may be a tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma and it may be a new therapeutic target for colorectal carcinoma.PMID: 27651344Title: High-doses of proton pumps inhibitors in refractory gastro-intestinal cancer: A case series and the state of art.Authors: Falcone R, Roberto M, D'Antonio C, Romiti A, Milano A, Onesti CE, Marchetti P, Fais SSource: Dig Liver Dis. 2016 Sep 1. pii: S1590-8658(16)30704-6. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2016.08.126.Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been investigated at high-dose to modulate tumour microenvironment acidification thus restoring chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Moreover, several clinical data supports the role of cytotoxic drugs at low-dose continuously delivered as anticancer therapy. METHODS: Clinical records of three patients affected with gastrointestinal cancer refractory to standard treatments, who had received a combination of high-dose rabeprazole and metronomic chemotherapy were reviewed. RESULTS: The first case, a 78-year-old man was treated for lung metastasis from colon adenocarcinoma. The second case, a 73-year-old man was treated for metastatic rectal cancer to the liver. The third one, a 68-year-old man, underwent the combination regimen for colon cancer with lung, liver and peritoneal metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the failure of previous standard chemotherapy for metastatic disease, good clinical outcome was shown in these patients treated with an unconventional association of high-dose PPIs and metronomic chemotherapy.PMID: 27651310Title: Chronic stress faciliates lung tumorigenesis by promoting exocytosis of IGF2 in lung epithelial cells.Authors: Jang HJ, Boo HJ, Lee HJ, Min HY, Lee HYSource: Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 20. pii: canres.0990.2016.Abstract: Molecular insights into how chronic stress affects lung tumorigenesis may offer new routes to chemoprevention. In this study, we show that chronic stress in mice chemically or genetically initiated for lung cancer leads to the release of norepinephrine (NE) and other catecholamines, thereby promoting lung tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, NE induced phosphorylation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) through the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR)-PKA pathway. VDCC triggered calcium mobilization, thereby inducing activation of IGF-1R via exocytosis of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Mice expressing lung-specific IGF-1R exhibited accelerated lung tumor development in response to chronic stress. Notably, clinically approved antihypertensive drugs that block L-type VDCC prevented the effects of chronic stress or NE on the IGF2/IGF-1R signaling cascade, along with transformation of lung epithelial cells and lung tumor formation. Overall, our results identify an actionable mechanism to limit the effects of chronic stress on lung tumorigenesis.PMID: 27651308Title: Efficacy of co-targeting Angiopoietin-2 and the VEGF pathway in the adjuvant postsurgical setting for early breast, colorectal and renal cancers.Authors: Wu FT, Man S, Xu P, Chow A, Paez-Ribes M, Lee CR, Pirie-Shepherd SR, Emmenegger U, Kerbel RSSource: Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 20. pii: canres.0888.2016.Abstract: Antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) have not been effective as adjuvant treatments for micrometastatic disease in phase III trials. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is a pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory vascular destabilizer that cooperates with VEGF. The purpose of this study was to test whether CVX-060 (an Ang2-specific CovX-body) can be combined with VEGFR2-targeting TKIs (sunitinib or regorafenib) to successfully treat postsurgical metastatic disease in multiple orthotopically implanted human tumor xenograft and syngeneic murine tumor models. In the MDA-MB-231.LM2-4 human breast cancer model, adjuvant sunitinib was ineffective while adjuvant CVX-060 delayed the progression of pulmonary or distant lymphatic metastases; however, overall survival was only improved with the adjuvant use of a VEGF-A/Ang2-bispecific CovX-body (CVX-241) but not when CVX-060 is combined with sunitinib. Adjuvant CVX-241 also showed promise in the EMT-6/CDDP murine breast cancer model, with or without an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1). In the RENCA model of mouse renal cancer, however, combining CVX-060 with sunitinib in the adjuvant setting was superior to CVX-241 as treatment for postsurgical lung metastases. In the HCT116 and HT29 xenograft models of colorectal cancer, both CVX-060 and regorafenib inhibited liver metastases. Overall, our preclinical findings suggest differential strategies by which Ang2 blockers can be successfully combined with VEGF pathway targeting in the adjuvant setting to treat micrometastatic disease - particularly, in combination with VEGF-A blockers (but not VEGFR2 TKIs) in resected breast cancer; in combination with VEGFR2 TKIs in resected kidney cancer; and as single agents or with VEGFR2 TKIs in resected colorectal cancer.PMID: 27651080Title: Feasibility of Biological Effective Monitoring of Chrome Electroplaters to Chromium through Analysis of Serum Malondialdehyde.Authors: Mozafari P, Rezazadeh Azari M, Shokoohi Y, Sayadi MSource: Int J Occup Environ Med. 2016 Oct;7(4):199-206.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Great concern about occupational exposure to chromium (Cr [VI]) has been reported due to escalated risk of lung cancer in exposed workers. Consequences of occupational exposure to Cr (VI) have been reported as oxidative stress and lung tissue damage. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of biological effect monitoring of chrome electroplaters through analysis of serum malondialdehyde (MDA). METHODS: 90 workers directly involved in chrome electroplating---categorized into three equal groups based on their job as near bath workers, degreaser, and washers---and 30 workers without exposure to Cr (VI), served as the control group, were studied. Personal samples were collected and analyzed according to NIOSH method 7600. Serum MDA level was measured by HPLC using a UV detector. RESULTS: Median Cr (VI) exposure level was 0.38 mg/m3 in near bath workers, 0.20 mg/m3 in degreasers, and 0.05 mg/m3 in washers. The median serum MDA level of three exposed groups (2.76 mumol/L) was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that in the control group (2.00 mumol/L). There was a positive correlation between electroplaters' level of exposure to Cr (VI) and their serum MDA level (Spearman's rho 0.806, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Serum MDA level is a good biomarker for the level of occupational exposure to Cr (VI) in electroplaters.PMID: 27650891Title: The DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3H haplotype I likely contributes to breast and lung cancer mutagenesis.Authors: Starrett GJ, Luengas EM, McCann JL, Ebrahimi D, Temiz NA, Love RP, Feng Y, Adolph MB, Chelico L, Law EK, Carpenter MA, Harris RSSource: Nat Commun. 2016 Sep 21;7:12918. doi: 10.1038/ncomms12918.Abstract: Cytosine mutations within TCA/T motifs are common in cancer. A likely cause is the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B). However, A3B-null breast tumours still have this mutational bias. Here we show that APOBEC3H haplotype I (A3H-I) provides a likely solution to this paradox. A3B-null tumours with this mutational bias have at least one copy of A3H-I despite little genetic linkage between these genes. Although deemed inactive previously, A3H-I has robust activity in biochemical and cellular assays, similar to A3H-II after compensation for lower protein expression levels. Gly105 in A3H-I (versus Arg105 in A3H-II) results in lower protein expression levels and increased nuclear localization, providing a mechanism for accessing genomic DNA. A3H-I also associates with clonal TCA/T-biased mutations in lung adenocarcinoma suggesting this enzyme makes broader contributions to cancer mutagenesis. These studies combine to suggest that A3B and A3H-I, together, explain the bulk of 'APOBEC signature' mutations in cancer.PMID: 27650844Title: Deploying Team Science Principles to Optimize Interdisciplinary Lung Cancer Care Delivery: Avoiding the Long and Winding Road to Optimal Care.Authors: Osarogiagbon RU, Rodriguez HP, Hicks D, Signore RS, Roark K, Kedia SK, Ward KD, Lathan C, Santarella S, Gould MK, Krasna MJSource: J Oncol Pract. 2016 Sep 20. pii: JOPR013813.Abstract: The complexity of lung cancer care mandates interaction between clinicians with different skill sets and practice cultures in the routine delivery of care. Using team science principles and a case-based approach, we exemplify the need for the development of real care teams for patients with lung cancer to foster coordination among the multiple specialists and staff engaged in routine care delivery. Achieving coordinated lung cancer care is a high-priority public health challenge because of the volume of patients, lethality of disease, and well-described disparities in quality and outcomes of care. Coordinating mechanisms need to be cultivated among different types of specialist physicians and care teams, with differing technical expertise and practice cultures, who have traditionally functioned more as coactively working groups than as real teams. Coordinating mechanisms, including shared mental models, high-quality communication, mutual trust, and mutual performance monitoring, highlight the challenge of achieving well-coordinated care and illustrate how team science principles can be used to improve quality and outcomes of lung cancer care. To develop the evidence base to support coordinated lung cancer care, research comparing the effectiveness of a diverse range of multidisciplinary care team approaches and interorganizational coordinating mechanisms should be promoted.PMID: 27650724Title: Tumor lymphocytic infiltration in non-small cell lung cancer: the ultimate prognostic marker?Authors: Romero Vielva LSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):370-372.Abstract: ?PMID: 27650590Title: Sparing healthy lung by focusing the radiation beam flow onto the emphysematous regions in the treatment of lung cancer.Authors: Jumeau R, Peguret N, de Bari B, Moeckli R, Soares-Rodrigues JL, Durham AD, Hojnowski S, Bourhis J, Ozsahin M, Beigelman-Aubry CSource: J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2016 Sep 21. doi: 10.1111/1754-9485.12516.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Currently, routine radiotherapy (RT) planning for locally advanced lung cancer (LC) does not take into consideration the functional state of the lung. The goal of this study was to determine if it is technically feasible to integrate the sites of pulmonary emphysema (PE) into the RT planning process. METHODS: Ten patients with LC and PE treated with helical Tomotherapy(c) were retrospectively included. After extraction by Myrian(c) software based on diagnostic CT (DCT), the PE data were transferred to the treatment planning system (TPS). PE-optimized plans were performed for patients with significant PE, where the dose was focused onto the PE. We compared the PE-optimized RT plans to the initial RT plans. RESULTS: The median dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 52 Gy (range, 36-66) in fractions of 2-3 Gy. The median PE volume was 220 cm3 (range: 12-1394), and six patients were eligible for a PE-optimized RT plan. Considering the lung without PE, the V20 and V30 variations were not significant (P > 0.05), the V5 decreased from 50% to 44% after re-planning (P < 0.05). The mean PTV D98 was 50 Gy versus 48 Gy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Focusing the RT beam flow on the PE structure rather than the healthy lung appears feasible, and may be a promising technique to help preserve pulmonary function and minimize RT-related pulmonary toxicity.PMID: 27650585Title: Recombinant canstatin inhibits VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and metastasis in an oral squamous cell carcinoma SCC-VII animal model.Authors: Hwang-Bo J, Park JH, Bae MG, Chung ISSource: Cancer Med. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/cam4.866.Abstract: We describe the inhibitory effects of recombinant canstatin on tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis induced by an oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using an orthotropic oral SCC animal model. Recombinant canstatin treatment decreased final tumor volumes and weights, as well as densities of blood and lymphatic vessels. Lung metastasis of oral SCC was significantly reduced in recombinant canstatin-treated animals. Recombinant canstatin reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression in SCC-VII cells treated with the hypoxia mimetic agent, CoCl2 . VEGF-A induced in vivo lymphatic vessel formation in a Matrigel plug, but this was remarkably reduced in a recombinant canstatin-treated Matrigel. Recombinant canstatin suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1 and -2 stimulated by VEGF-A. Based on immunohistochemical analysis, recombinant canstatin significantly reduced the expression of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, and -2 in SCC-VII-induced tumors. Recombinant canstatin did not affect the expression of VEGF-C or VEGFR-3. In addition, recombinant canstatin suppressed the VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and -2. Our results indicate that recombinant canstatin exhibits antitumoral and antilymphangiogenic activities against oral SCC cells. Antilymphangiogenic signaling by recombinant canstatin is probably mediated by the suppression of the integrin alphavbeta3/VEGFR-1 and/or -2 signaling induced by VEGF-A. Our results also suggest that recombinant canstatin has a high potential to inhibit oral SCC-induced tumors and lymphatic metastasis.PMID: 27650543Title: Identification of small molecule inhibitors of ERCC1-XPF that inhibit DNA repair and potentiate cisplatin efficacy in cancer cells.Authors: Arora S, Heyza J, Zhang H, Kalman-Maltese V, Tillison K, Floyd AM, Chalfin EM, Bepler G, Patrick SMSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 16. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12072.Abstract: ERCC1-XPF heterodimer is a 5'-3' structure-specific endonuclease which is essential in multiple DNA repair pathways in mammalian cells. ERCC1-XPF (ERCC1-ERCC4) repairs cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adducts and interstrand crosslinks and its specific inhibition has been shown to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In this study, we describe a high throughput screen (HTS) used to identify small molecules that inhibit the endonuclease activity of ERCC1-XPF. Primary screens identified two compounds that inhibit ERCC1-XPF activity in the nanomolar range. These compounds were validated in secondary screens against two other non-related endonucleases to ensure specificity. Results from these screens were validated using an in vitro gel-based nuclease assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) further show that these compounds do not inhibit the binding of purified ERCC1-XPF to DNA. Next, in lung cancer cells these compounds potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity and inhibited DNA repair. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies identified related compounds for one of the original Hits, which also potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Excitingly, dosing with NSC16168 compound potentiated cisplatin antitumor activity in a lung cancer xenograft model. Further development of ERCC1-XPF DNA repair inhibitors is expected to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage-based chemotherapy.PMID: 27650539Title: The other face of miR-17-92a cluster, exhibiting tumor suppressor effects in prostate cancer.Authors: Ottman R, Levy J, Williams GE, Chakrabarti RSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 16. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12061.Abstract: miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs are transcribed from a polycistronic transcription unit C13orf25 that generates six mature miRNAs, miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a that are overexpressed in lung and colon cancers. Here we show that the expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs are reduced in cancerous prostate tissues compared to uninvolved areas and also in aggressive prostate cancer cells. Restoration of expression of all members of miR-17-92a cluster showed, decreased expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and SSH1; and LIMK1 and FGD4 of RhoGTPase signaling pathway. Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs caused decreased cell proliferation, reduced activation of AKT and MAP kinases, delayed tumorigenicity and reduced tumor growth in animals. Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs inhibited EMT via reduced cell migration and expression of mesenchymal markers while elevating expression and surface localization of the epithelial marker E-Cadherin. Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs improved sensitivity of androgen dependent LNCaP 104-S prostate cancer cells to anti-androgen drug Casodex, AKT inhibitor MK-2206 2HCl, and docetaxel. The androgen refractory PC-3 cells also showed increased sensitivity to docetaxel, MK-2206 2HCl and Aurora kinase inhibitor VX680 upon ectopic expression of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs. Our data demonstrate a tumor suppressor effect of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in prostate cancer cells and restoration of expression of these miRNAs has a therapeutic benefit for both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.PMID: 27650513Title: Unraveling the genomic complexity of small cell lung cancer.Authors: Karachaliou N, Sosa AE, Rosell RSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):363-366.Abstract: ?PMID: 27650509Title: Selection of Patients in Ongoing Clinical Trials on Lung Cancer.Authors: Schulkes KJ, Nguyen C, van den Bos F, van Elden LJ, Hamaker MESource: Lung. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly: half of all newly diagnosed patients are over 70 years old. Older patients and those with comorbidities are underrepresented in clinical trials; scientific communities have addressed this issue since the end of the 20th century. We set out to determine the characteristics of the selection of patients in lung cancer trials that are currently recruiting. METHODS: We searched The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial registry ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) on April 23, 2015 for currently recruiting phase I, II, or III clinical trials in lung cancer. Trial characteristics and study objectives were extracted from the registry website. RESULTS: Of the 419 trails selected in this overview, 88 % explicitly or implicitly excluded elderly patients. Patients were excluded based on stringent organ selection in 76 % of the trials, based on performance status (57 %) and based on age (13 %). The median number of placed restrictions per trial was seven. In the 2 % of the trials that were exclusively designed for elderly patients only fit patients were included. CONCLUSION: In this overview of current lung cancer trials registered in the NIH clinical trial registry, we found that elderly patients and those with comorbidities are often excluded from participation in clinical trials. Therefore, it is difficult for physicians and their frail patients to properly evaluate the efficacy and safety of current treatment options. More research that includes the elderly and those with comorbidities is urgently needed.PMID: 27650486Title: ZNF703 Overexpression may act as an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Baykara O, Dalay N, Kaynak K, Buyru NSource: Cancer Med. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/cam4.847.Abstract: Despite therapeutic advances, lung cancer remains one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The ZNF703 gene has been identified as the driver of the 8p11-12 region and its amplification or overexpression has been associated with several types of cancers. It has also been shown that ZNF703 overexpression can activate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of the ZNF703 gene in association with Akt/mTOR activation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression levels in tumors and matched noncancerous tissue samples from 47 patients were analyzed by qRT-PCR and the Akt phosphorylation levels were investigated by Western blotting. Our results show that ZNF703 is up-regulated in 63.4% of NSCLC tumor samples. Althogh the correlation did not reach a statistically significant level Akt phosphorylation was increased in tumor tissues expressing high levels of ZNF703. The role of the ZNF703 gene has not been investigated in NSCLC. Our data show that ZNF703 may contribute to tumor development in NSCLC by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway.PMID: 27650483Title: African Ancestry-Specific Alleles and Kidney Disease Risk in Hispanics/Latinos.Authors: Kramer HJ, Stilp AM, Laurie CC, Reiner AP, Lash J, Daviglus ML, Rosas SE, Ricardo AC, Tayo BO, Flessner MF, Kerr KF, Peralta C, Durazo-Arvizu R, Conomos M, Thornton T, Rotter J, Taylor KD, Cai J, Eckfeldt J, Chen H, Papanicolau G, Franceschini NSource: J Am Soc Nephrol. 2016 Sep 20. pii: ASN.2016030357.Abstract: African ancestry alleles may contribute to CKD among Hispanics/Latinos, but whether associations differ by Hispanic/Latino background remains unknown. We examined the association of CKD measures with African ancestry-specific APOL1 alleles that were directly genotyped and sickle cell trait (hemoglobin subunit beta gene [HBB] variant) on the basis of imputation in 12,226 adult Hispanics/Latinos grouped according to Caribbean or Mainland background. We also performed an unbiased genome-wide association scan of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios. Overall, 41.4% of participants were male, 44.6% of participants had a Caribbean background, and the mean age of all participants was 46.1 years. The Caribbean background group, compared with the Mainland background group, had a higher frequency of two APOL1 alleles (1.0% versus 0.1%) and the HBB variant (2.0% versus 0.7%). In the Caribbean background group, presence of APOL1 alleles (2 versus 0/1 copies) or the HBB variant (1 versus 0 copies) were significantly associated with albuminuria (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7 to 6.1; and OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8, respectively) and albuminuria and/or eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.4; and OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.5, respectively). The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio genome-wide association scan identified associations with the HBB variant among all participants, with the strongest association in the Caribbean background group (P=3.1x10-10 versus P=9.3x10-3 for the Mainland background group). In conclusion, African-specific alleles associate with CKD in Hispanics/Latinos, but allele frequency varies by Hispanic/Latino background/ancestry.PMID: 27650363Title: Afatinib in lung cancer harboring EGFR mutation in the LUX-Lung trials: six plus three is greater than seven?Authors: Mitsudomi T, Kobayashi YSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):446-449.Abstract: ?PMID: 27650313Title: The NLRP3 inflammasome in pathogenic particle and fibre-associated lung inflammation and diseases.Authors: Sayan M, Mossman BTSource: Part Fibre Toxicol. 2016 Sep 20;13(1):51.Abstract: The concept of the inflammasome, a macromolecular complex sensing cell stress or danger signals and initiating inflammation, was first introduced approximately a decade ago. Priming and activation of these intracellular protein platforms trigger the maturation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18, to promulgate innate immune defenses. Although classically studied in models of gout, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the importance and mechanisms of action of inflammasome priming and activation have recently been elucidated in cells of the respiratory tract where they modulate the responses to a number of inhaled pathogenic particles and fibres. Most notably, inflammasome activation appears to regulate the balance between tissue repair and inflammation after inhalation of pathogenic pollutants such as asbestos, crystalline silica (CS), and airborne particulate matter (PM). Different types of fibres and particles may have distinct mechanisms of inflammasome interaction and outcome. This review summarizes the structure and function of inflammasomes, the interplay between various chemokines and cytokines and cell types of the lung and pleura after inflammasome activation, and the events leading to the development of non-malignant (allergic airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asbestosis, silicosis) and malignant (mesothelioma, lung cancer) diseases by pathogenic particulates. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of communication between cells of the immune system, target cells of these diseases, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulation of inflammasome-mediated events.PMID: 27650165Title: B-RAF mutation in non-small cell lung cancer: the sleeping beauty is waking up.Authors: Rolfo C, Caparica RSource: Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;5(4):367-369.Abstract: ?PMID: 27650132Title: Immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer: report from an international experts panel meeting of the Italian association of thoracic oncology.Authors: Gridelli C, Ascierto PA, Barberis MC, Felip E, Garon EB, O'brien M, Senan S, Casaluce F, Sgambato A, Papadimitrakopoulou V, De Marinis FSource: Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2016 Sep 21:1-11.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The potential long term survival gain, related to immune adaptability and memory, the potential activity across multiple tumour types through targeting the immune system, and the opportunity for combinations offered by the unique mechanism of actions and safety profile of these new agents, all support the role of immunotherapy in the cancer treatment pathway or paradigm. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the recent advances in the understanding of immunology and antitumor immune responses that have led to the development of new immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint pathways, such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Currently, two PD-1 inhibitors are available in clinical practice for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): nivolumab and pembrolizumab. EXPERT OPINION: Ongoing research will dictate future strategies, including the potential incorporation of immunotherapy in stage dependent treatment settings (early stage locally advanced disease and first line therapy for metastatic disease). Immunotherapy combinations are promising avenues, and careful selection of patients, doses of each agent and information supporting strategies (i.e. concomitant or sequential) is still needed.PMID: 27650104Title: Prognostic Differences in Subgroups of Patients With Surgically Resected T3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.Authors: Jeon JH, Kim MS, Moon DH, Yang HC, Hwangbo B, Kim HY, Lee JM, Lee GKSource: Ann Thorac Surg. 2016 Sep 17. pii: S0003-4975(16)30433-7. doi: 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.04.096.Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study determined the characteristics and prognosis of each descriptor of T3 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 3,241 patients underwent an operation for NSCLC between 2001 and 2013, and this study included 461 patients who received complete anatomic resection of T3 NSCLC. The T3 descriptors were coded as follows: tumor invading main bronchus within 2 cm of the carina (T3-cent), tumor invading beyond visceral pleura (T3-inv), tumor larger than 7 cm (T3-size), separate tumor nodules (T3-sep), or tumor with combined T3 descriptors (T3-comb). RESULTS: The T3 distribution was as follows: T3-cent, 75 patients (16.3%); T3-inv, 157 patients (34.1%); T3-size, 132 patients (28.6%); T3-sep, 34 patients (7.4%); and T3-comb, 63 patients (13.7%). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant survival benefit in the T3-cent group compared with the other groups (all p < 0.05). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) values were 55.4%, 36.7%, 40.9%, 30.3%, and 32.0% in the T3-cent, T3-inv, T3-size, T3-sep, and T3-comb subgroups, respectively. Multivariable analyses revealed that age (p = 0.019), N status (p = 0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.001), and T3 descriptors (T3-cent versus others, p < 0.001) were the most important independent prognostic factors for DFS. Additional analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors for DFS in the T3-cent group. Multivariable analysis revealed that bronchoplastic procedures (p = 0.004) was an independent prognostic factor for DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Survival for centrally located T3 NSCLC is better than other types of T3 NSCLC. Lung-preserving operations such as bronchoplastic procedures might result in improved survival of these patients.PMID: 27650013Title: The first patient treatment of electromagnetic-guided real time adaptive radiotherapy using MLC tracking for lung SABR.Authors: Booth JT, Caillet V, Hardcastle N, O'Brien R, Szymura K, Crasta C, Harris B, Haddad C, Eade T, Keall PJSource: Radiother Oncol. 2016 Sep 17. pii: S0167-8140(16)34289-X. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2016.08.025.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Real time adaptive radiotherapy that enables smaller irradiated volumes may reduce pulmonary toxicity. We report on the first patient treatment of electromagnetic-guided real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking for lung stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical trial was developed to investigate the safety and feasibility of MLC tracking in lung. The first patient was an 80-year old man with a single left lower lobe lung metastasis to be treated with SABR to 48Gy in 4 fractions. In-house software was integrated with a standard linear accelerator to adapt the treatment beam shape and position based on electromagnetic transponders implanted in the lung. MLC tracking plans were compared against standard ITV-based treatment planning. MLC tracking plan delivery was reconstructed in the patient to confirm safe delivery. RESULTS: Real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking compared to standard ITV-based planning reduced the PTV by 41% (18.7-11cm3) and the mean lung dose by 30% (202-140cGy), V20 by 35% (2.6-1.5%) and V5 by 9% (8.9-8%). CONCLUSION: An emerging technology, MLC tracking, has been translated into the clinic and used to treat lung SABR patients for the first time. This milestone represents an important first step for clinical real-time adaptive radiotherapy that could reduce pulmonary toxicity in lung radiotherapy.PMID: 27649690Title: Predictors of long-term compensatory response of pulmonary function following major lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Takahashi Y, Matsutani N, Morita S, Dejima H, Nakayama T, Uehara H, Kawamura MSource: Respirology. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1111/resp.12904.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Long-term pulmonary function which might include compensatory response (CR) significantly influences quality of life of long-term survivor after major lung resection. We investigated long-term pulmonary function after major lung resection. METHODS: A total of 137 patients who had undergone lobar resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from May 2013 to June 2014 had spirometry at 10-14 months after surgery. Actual post-operative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) (FEV1apo )/predicted post-operative FEV1 (FEV1ppo ), actual post-operative forced vital capacity (FVC) (FVCapo )/predicted post-operative FVC (FVCppo ), its relationship with clinicopathological factors and immunohistochemistry for pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SPC), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were investigated. RESULTS: FEV1apo /FEV1ppo showed strong correlation with FVCapo /FVCppo (r = 0.628; P < 0.001). We defined greater CR as both FEV1apo /FEV1ppo and FVCapo /FVCppo were >120%. Greater CR was significantly associated with decreased smoking index (P < 0.001) and greater resected subsegments (P = 0.037). The never-smoker group revealed significantly greater CR compared with the smoker group in both FEV1apo /FEV1ppo (119.9 +/- 12.5% vs 107.5 +/- 14.2%; P = 0.030) and FVCapo /FVCppo (117.9 +/- 9.98% vs 107.2 +/- 13.1%; P = 0.046) in case-matched comparison. The expression of pro-SPC, TTF-1 and VEGFR2 in the normal lung parenchyma of greater CR group was significantly higher than those of lesser CR group (P < 0.001 for each). In addition, pro-SPC, TTF-1 and VEGFR2 expressions showed a significant correlation to the degree of CR especially in the smoker group (r = 0.631, 0.705 and 0.732, respectively; P < 0.001 for each). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that smokers may develop lesser long-term CR after major lung resection. Decreased expression of pro-SPC, TTF-1 and VEGFR2 may indicate decreased capacity of CR, especially in patients who smoke.PMID: 27649680Title: Ginkgo biloba exocarp extracts inhibits angiogenesis and its effects on Wnt/beta-catenin-VEGF signaling pathway in Lewis lung cancer.Authors: Han D, Cao C, Su Y, Wang J, Sun J, Chen H, Xu ASource: J Ethnopharmacol. 2016 Sep 17. pii: S0378-8741(16)30744-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2016.09.018.Abstract: ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A fruit of Ginkgo biloba L. also known as Ginkgo biloba, can be used for the treatment of cancer in Chinese traditional medicine. The scientific name of succulent skin, which is the episperm of Ginkgo nuts, is exocarp. Experiment shows that Ginkgo biloba exocarp extracts (GBEE) has the effects of immune promotion, cancer inhibition and etc. AIM OF STUDY: Study on the activity of GBEE against Lewis lung cancer (LLC) angiogenesis and its partial molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of GBEE on proliferation of LLC cells was detected by MTT method in vitro. The metastasis model of LLC was set up. The C57BL/6J mice were randomly separated into normal control, model control, positive control and GBEE (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) treatment groups, n=10. The mice in normal group and model group were both intragastric gavage (i.g.) normal saline (NS) in a volume of 0.1 mL/10g (b.w.), positive group were intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection cyclophosphamide (CPA) at a dose of 20 mg/kg (b.w.) , the GBEE treatment groups were respectively i.g. GBEE 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg (b.w.), once a day for 20d. After treatment, we calculated the tumor inhibition rate and anti-metastasis rate. The microvessel density ( MVD) was measured by immunohistochemistry method in transplanted tumor. The expression levels of vascular en-dothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGFR2 mRNA or Wnt3a, beta-catenin, VEGF, VEGFR2 and p-Akt/Akt protein expression were respectively tested by Quantitative Reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot in vitro and vivo. RESULTS: GBEE suppressed the growth of LLC cells in a dose-dependent way at the dose of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 microg/mL in vitro. It can suppressed Wnt3a and beta-catenin protein expression and the content of mRNA of VEGF and VEGFR2 in LLC cells significantly. In vivo, we discovered GBEE can retard the growth of LLC transplanted tumor in a dose-dependent way at the dose of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg, suppressing tumor lung metastasis. The expression of CD34 was reduced, which means MVD was inhibited and so do beta-catenin, VEGF, VEGFR2 and p-AKT/AKT protein expression and VEGF and VEGFR2 mRNA expression levels in LLC transplanted tumor of C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSIONS: GBEE played the effects of anti-tumor and anti-metastatic depending upon the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, which may be closely relevant to its effect in blockage of Wnt /beta-catenin-VEGF signaling pathway in LLC.PMID: 27649551Title: Ipilimumab with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy: Phase I results and immunologic correlates from peripheral T-cells.Authors: Tang C, Welsh JW, de Groot P, Massarelli E, Chang JY, Hess KR, Basu S, Curran MA, Cabanillas ME, Subbiah V, Fu S, Tsimberidou AM, Karp D, Gomez DR, Diab A, Komaki R, Sharma P, Naing A, Hong DSSource: Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 20. pii: clincanres.1432.2016.Abstract: PURPOSE: Little prospective data is available on clinical outcomes and immune correlates from combination radiation and immunotherapy. We conducted a phase I trial (NCT02239900) testing stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) with ipilimumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SABR was given either concurrently (1 day after the first dose) or sequentially (1 week after the second dose) with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses) to 5 treatment groups: concurrent 50 Gy (in 4 fractions) to liver; sequential 50 Gy (in 4 fractions) to liver; concurrent 50 Gy (in 4 fractions) to lung; sequential 50 Gy (in 4 fractions) to lung; and sequential 60 Gy (in 10 fractions) to lung or liver. Maximum tolerated dose was determined with a 3+3 dose de-escalation design. Immune marker expression was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Among 35 patients who initiated ipilimumab, 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicity and 12 (34%) grade 3 toxicity. Response outside the radiation field was assessable in 31 patients. Three patients (10%) exhibited partial response and 7 (23%) experienced clinical benefit (defined as partial response or stable disease lasting {greater than or equal to}6 months). Clinical benefit was associated with increases in peripheral CD8+ T-cells; CD8+/CD4+ T-cell ratio; and proportion of CD8+ T-cells expressing 4-1BB and PD1. Liver (vs. lung) irradiation produced greater T-cell activation, reflected as increases in the proportions of peripheral T-cells expressing ICOS, GITR, and 4-1BB. CONCLUSIONS: Combining SABR and ipilimumab was safe with signs of efficacy; peripheral T-cell markers may predict clinical benefit; and systemic immune activation was greater after liver irradiation.PMID: 27649450Title: Interaction of the Human Papillomavirus E6 Oncoprotein with Sorting Nexin 27 Modulates Endocytic Cargo Transport Pathways.Authors: Ganti K, Massimi P, Manzo-Merino J, Tomaic V, Pim D, Playford MP, Lizano M, Roberts S, Kranjec C, Doorbar J, Banks LSource: PLoS Pathog. 2016 Sep 20;12(9):e1005854. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005854. eCollection 2016 Sep.Abstract: A subset of high-risk Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of a large number of human cancers, of which cervical is the most common. Two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, contribute directly towards the development and maintenance of malignancy. A characteristic feature of the E6 oncoproteins from cancer-causing HPV types is the presence of a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at its C-terminus, which confers interaction with cellular proteins harbouring PDZ domains. Here we show that this motif allows E6 interaction with Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27), an essential component of endosomal recycling pathways. This interaction is highly conserved across E6 proteins from multiple high-risk HPV types and is mediated by a classical PBM-PDZ interaction but unlike many E6 targets, SNX27 is not targeted for degradation by E6. Rather, in HPV-18 positive cell lines the association of SNX27 with components of the retromer complex and the endocytic transport machinery is altered in an E6 PBM-dependent manner. Analysis of a SNX27 cargo, the glucose transporter GLUT1, reveals an E6-dependent maintenance of GLUT1 expression and alteration in its association with components of the endocytic transport machinery. Furthermore, knockdown of E6 in HPV-18 positive cervical cancer cells phenocopies the loss of SNX27, both in terms of GLUT1 expression levels and its vesicular localization, with a concomitant marked reduction in glucose uptake, whilst loss of SNX27 results in slower cell proliferation in low nutrient conditions. These results demonstrate that E6 interaction with SNX27 can alter the recycling of cargo molecules, one consequence of which is modulation of nutrient availability in HPV transformed tumour cells.PMID: 27649287Title: Ephrin-B2 overexpression predicts for poor prognosis and response to therapy in solid tumors.Authors: Oweida A, Bhatia S, Hirsch K, Calame D, Griego A, Keysar S, Pitts T, Sharma J, Eckhardt G, Jimeno A, Wang XJ, Parkash G, Califano J, Karam SSource: Mol Carcinog. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/mc.22574.Abstract: Ephrin B2 is variably expressed on tumor cells and its blockade has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in animal models of pancreatic, colorectal, lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. However, the implications of ephrinB2 expression in cancer patients have remained elusive. In this study, we analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) for ephrinB2 expression. We report significant correlations between EFNB2 expression, overall survival and disease-free survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC, n = 519), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 186) and bladder urothelial carcinoma (n = 410). In HNSCC patients, high EFNB2 mRNA expression was associated with tumor HPV negativity, oral cavity location, alcohol intake, higher TP53 mutation, and EGFR amplification. EphrinB2 overexpression also correlated with worse response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The therapeutic potential of blocking ephrinB2 was validated in HNSCC patient-derived tumor xenografts and showed significant improvement in survival and tumor growth delay. Our data shows that ephrinB2 overexpression can serve as a critical biomarker for patient prognosis and response to therapy. These results should guide design of future clinical trials exploring EphrinB2 inhibition in cancer patients. This article is protected by copyright.

The discovery of an oncogenic function and the identification of onco-metabolites of IDH1/2 support new roles for metabolism in cancer. For example, some evidence indicates that IDH2 might also exhibit oncogenic functions by promoting cellular metabolism and cancer cell growth. We examined the association between IDH2 rs11540478 and lung cancer risk in 262 lung cancer patient cases and 602 healthy control subjects and also investigated the biological function of rs11540478 in vivo. We found that a higher risk was observed in lung cancer patient carriers of rs11540478 TT and CT compared with CC carriers(OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.04-2.00; p = 0.03). The frequency of IDH2 rs11540478 TT and CT carriers was decreased in healthy individuals between the ages of 50-77 compared to those aged 30-49 (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.47-0.96; p = 0.03). Functional analysis showed the effect of rs11540478 on IDH2 expression and lung cancer cell viability, with higher IDH2 expression and cell viability among T allele compared with C allele. IDH2 mRNA was higher in peripheral blood lymphocytes from lung cancer patients compared to healthy subjects. Herein, for the first time we identified IDH2 rs11540478 as a new susceptibility locus for lung cancer. The effect of rs11540478 on mRNA expression of IDH2 and lung cancer cell viability might provide new insight for the genetic basis of lung cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

While previous studies have evaluated relationships between demographic characteristics and decision-making roles, less is known about the association of symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics (e.g., coping styles, personality traits) and decision-making roles. METHODS: As part of a larger study of symptom clusters, patients (n = 765) receiving chemotherapy (CTX) for breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer provided information on demographic, clinical, symptom, and psychological adjustment characteristics. Patient-reported treatment decision-making roles (i.e., preferred role, and role actually played) were assessed using the Control Preferences Scale. Differences among patients, who were classified as passive, collaborative, or active, were evaluated using Chi square analyses and analyses of variance. RESULTS: Over half (56.3%) of the patients reported both that they preferred, and that they actually played, a collaborative role. Among those patients with concordant roles, those who were older, those with less education and lower income, and those who were less resilient were more likely to prefer a passive role. Several psychological adjustment characteristics were associated with decision-making role, including coping style, personality, and fatalism. CONCLUSIONS: Oncology patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decision-making are associated with demographic characteristics as well as with symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics, such as coping style and personality. These results reaffirm the complexities of predicting patients' preferences for involvement in decision-making. Further study is needed to determine if role or coping style may be influenced by interventions designed to teach adaptive coping skills.PMID: 27648963Title: Thyroid Function and Cancer Risk: The Rotterdam Study.Authors: Khan SR, Chaker L, Ruiter R, Aerts JG, Hofman A, Dehghan A, Franco OH, Stricker BH, Peeters RPSource: J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2016 Sep 20:jc20162104.Abstract: CONTEXT: In vitro and in vivo experiments have assigned both oncosuppressive and oncogenic properties to thyroid hormones. Population-based studies found inconclusive results. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively assess the relation between thyroid function and incident cancer in a population based setting. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The current study is a prospective population-based cohort study including 10,318 participants for whom baseline measurements of free thyroxine (FT4) and/or thyrotropin (TSH) were available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) of any solid non-skin cancer, as well as lung, breast, prostate and gastrointestinal cancer specifically. RESULTS: Higher FT4 levels were associated with a higher risk of any solid cancer (HR: 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.79), lung cancer (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.39-3.92) and breast (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.10-2.84) cancer. The risk estimates were similar after exclusion of thyroid-altering medication, but the association lost significance for breast cancer. Compared to the lowest FT4 tertile, the highest tertile was associated with a 1.13 fold increased risk of any solid, 1.79 fold increased risk of lung and 1.14 fold increased risk of breast cancer (p for trend < 0.05 for all). For TSH levels we found no associations with cancer risk. There was no differential effect of sex or age on the association between thyroid function and cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher FT4 levels are significantly associated with an increased risk of any solid, lung and breast cancer. Further research should elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.PMID: 27648949Title: Evaluation of Dose Distribution in Intensity Modulated Radiosurgery for Lung Cancer under Condition of Respiratory Motion.Authors: Yoon MS, Jeong JU, Nam TK, Ahn SJ, Chung WK, Song JYSource: PLoS One. 2016 Sep 20;11(9):e0163112. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163112. eCollection 2016.Abstract: The dose of a real tumor target volume and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) under the effect of respiratory motion was calculated for a lung tumor plan, based on the target volume covering the whole tumor motion range for intensity modulated radiosurgery (IMRS). Two types of IMRS plans based on simulated respiratory motion were designed using humanoid and dynamic phantoms. Delivery quality assurance (DQA) was performed using ArcCHECK and MapCHECK2 for several moving conditions of the tumor and the real dose inside the humanoid phantom was evaluated using the 3DVH program. This evaluated dose in the tumor target and OAR using the 3DVH program was higher than the calculated dose in the plan, and a greater difference was seen for the RapidArc treatment than for the standard intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with fixed gantry angle beams. The results of this study show that for IMRS plans based on target volume, including the whole tumor motion range, tighter constraints of the OAR should be considered in the optimization process. The method devised in this study can be applied effectively to analyze the dose distribution in the real volume of tumor target and OARs in IMRT plans targeting the whole tumor motion range.PMID: 27648814Title: Enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with visceral disease in the liver and/or lung: Outcomes from the randomized controlled phase 3 AFFIRM trial.Authors: Loriot Y, Fizazi K, de Bono JS, Forer D, Hirmand M, Scher HISource: Cancer. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.30336.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and visceral metastases have a worse prognosis than those with nonvisceral metastases. Treatment with the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in the phase 3 AFFIRM trial led to significant improvements in outcomes for patients with mCRPC. For the current report, the authors analyzed the efficacy of enzalutamide among patients from the AFFIRM trial who had visceral disease. METHODS: Patients who had liver and/or lung metastases at baseline were selected for prespecified overall survival (OS) and exploratory post hoc analyses, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and the time to PSA and radiographic progression. RESULTS: In patients who had liver metastases (n = 92), enzalutamide was associated with a lower risk of radiographic progression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.645; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.413-1.008), improved 12-month OS (37.7% vs 20.6%) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (11.6% vs 3.0%) rates, and higher PSA response rates (35.1% vs 4.8%) compared with placebo. Enzalutamide-treated patients who had lung metastases (n = 104) had improved median OS (HR, 0.848; 95% CI, 0.510-1.410), a substantially reduced risk of radiographic progression (HR, 0.386; 95% CI, 0.259-0.577), improved 12-month OS (65.1% vs 55.3%) and rPFS (30.9% vs 8.2%) rates, increased time to PSA progression (HR, 0.358; 95% CI, 0.204-0.627), and a better PSA response rate (52.1% vs 4.9%) compared with those who received placebo. No increase in treatment-related adverse events was observed for the visceral metastases cohort compared with the nonvisceral metastases cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Across multiple endpoints, patients who have visceral metastases have better outcomes with enzalutamide than with placebo. Cancer 2016.

We were interested in examining the theoretical effects of substituting plant-based fats from different types of margarine for animal based fat from butter on the risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: We prospectively studied 71,410 women, aged 50-79 years, and evaluated their risk for clinical myocardial infarction (MI), total coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis-related CVD with an average of 13.2 years of follow-up. Butter and margarine intakes were obtained at baseline and Year 3 by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression using a cumulative average diet method was used to estimate the theoretical effect of substituting 1 teaspoon/day of three types of margarine for the same amount of butter. RESULTS: Substituting butter or stick margarine with tub margarine was associated with lower risk of MI (HRs=0.95 and 0.91). Subgroup analyses, which evaluated these substitutions among participants with a single source of spreadable fat, showed stronger associations for MI (HRs=0.92 and 0.87). Outcomes of total CHD, ischemic stroke, and atherosclerosis-related CVD showed wide confidence intervals but the same trends as the MI results. CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical dietary substitution analysis suggests that substituting butter and stick margarine with tub margarine when spreadable fats are eaten may be associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction.PMID: 27648369Title: Haptoglobin is a serological biomarker for adenocarcinoma lung cancer by using the ProteomeLab PF2D combined with mass spectrometry.Authors: Chang YK, Lai YH, Chu Y, Lee MC, Huang CY, Wu SSource: Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 1;6(8):1828-36. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Identification of serological biomarker is urgently needed for cancer screening, monitoring cancer progression, treatment response, and surveillance for recurrence in lung cancer. Therefore, we try to find new serological biomarker that has more specificity and sensitivity for lung cancer diagnostics. In this study, the 2-D liquid phase fractionation system (PF2D) and mass spectrometry approach has been used for comparison the serum profiles between lung cancer patients and healthy individuals. Eight proteins were identified form PF2D and subsequently by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, haptoglobin (HP) and apolipoprotein AI (APOA1) were chosen and validated with turbidimetric assay. We found that HP levels were significantly higher and APOA1 levels were significantly lower in lung cancer patients. However, after the participants were stratified by gender, the expression trends of HP and APOA1 in lung cancer patients existed only in men, which is gender specific phenomenon. HP, APOA1 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), used for distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma, had a sensitivity of 64%, 64% and 79%, respectively. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of HP, APOA1 and CEA were 0.768, 0.761 and 0.884, respectively. When restricted to male subjects, HP, APOA1 and CEA showed sensitivity of 89%, 73% and 100%, respectively. AUC of HP, APOA1 and CEA were 0.929, 0.840 and 0.877, respectively. Therefore, our results showed that combined with PF2D system and mass spectrometry, this is a promising novel approach to identify new serological biomarkers for lung cancer research. In addition, HP may be a potential serological biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma diagnostics, especially in male subjects.PMID: 27648353Title: A perspective on anti-EGFR therapies targeting triple-negative breast cancer.Authors: Nakai K, Hung MC, Yamaguchi HSource: Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 1;6(8):1609-23. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), accounts for about 15-20% of breast cancers and is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. There are currently no effective therapies against metastatic TNBC. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population. In this review, we describe some of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR inhibitor sensitivity and further discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC.PMID: 27648343Title: The Advanced Practitioner and Collaborative Practice in Oncology.Authors: Kurtin SE, Peterson M, Goforth P, May MB, Viale PH, Smith WJ, Rust D, Grande C, Nix NM, Bishop CSSource: J Adv Pract Oncol. 2015 Nov-Dec;6(6):515-27.

Epub 2016 Aug 28.Abstract: Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) metastases to skeletal muscle are extremely rare and usually found in patients with advanced stage cancer. The most common sites of bladder cancer metastases are lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bones. Muscle is an unusual site of metastases from a distant primary cancer, due to several protective factors. We present a rare case of 76-year-old patient with metastases in the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscles, 2 years after a radical cystectomy for invasive UCC of the bladder. This case is the first description of a forearm lesion, with an extensive infiltration of the volar compartments of the forearm, and the first one with a clear functional impairment.PMID: 27648281Title: Toxicity and dosimetric analysis of non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with 4DCT and image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy: a regional centre's experience.Authors: Livingston GC, Last AJ, Shakespeare TP, Dwyer PM, Westhuyzen J, McKay MJ, Connors L, Leader S, Greenham SSource: J Med Radiat Sci. 2016 Sep;63(3):170-8. doi: 10.1002/jmrs.159. Epub 2016 Feb 15.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: For patients receiving radiotherapy for locally advance non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the probability of experiencing severe radiation pneumonitis (RP) appears to rise with an increase in radiation received by the lungs. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) provides the ability to reduce planned doses to healthy organs at risk (OAR) and can potentially reduce treatment-related side effects. This study reports toxicity outcomes and provides a dosimetric comparison with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). METHODS: Thirty curative NSCLC patients received radiotherapy using four-dimensional computed tomography and five-field IMRT. All were assessed for early and late toxicity using common terminology criteria for adverse events. All plans were subsequently re-planned using 3DCRT to the same standard as the clinical plans. Dosimetric parameters for lungs, oesophagus, heart and conformity were recorded for comparison between the two techniques. RESULTS: IMRT plans achieved improved high-dose conformity and reduced OAR doses including lung volumes irradiated to 5-20 Gy. One case each of oesophagitis and erythema (3%) were the only Grade 3 toxicities. Rates of Grade 2 oesophagitis were 40%. No cases of Grade 3 RP were recorded and Grade 2 RP rates were as low as 3%. CONCLUSION: IMRT provides a dosimetric benefit when compared to 3DCRT. While the clinical benefit appears to increase with increasing target size and increasing complexity, IMRT appears preferential to 3DCRT in the treatment of NSCLC.PMID: 27648167Title: Helical tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy: New therapeutic arms in the breast cancer radiotherapy.Authors: Lauche O, Kirova YM, Fenoglietto P, Costa E, Lemanski C, Bourgier C, Riou O, Tiberi D, Campana F, Fourquet A, Azria DSource: World J Radiol. 2016 Aug 28;8(8):735-42. doi: 10.4329/wjr.v8.i8.735.Abstract: AIM: To analyse clinical and dosimetric results of helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in complex adjuvant breast and nodes irradiation. METHODS: Seventy-three patients were included (31 HT and 42 VMAT). Dose were 63.8 Gy (HT) and 63.2 Gy (VMAT) in the tumour bed, 52.2 Gy in the breast, 50.4 Gy in supraclavicular nodes (SCN) and internal mammary chain (IMC) with HT and 52.2 Gy and 49.3 Gy in IMC and SCN with VMAT in 29 fractions. Margins to particle tracking velocimetry were greater in the VMAT cohort (7 mm vs 5 mm). RESULTS: For the HT cohort, the coverage of clinical target volumes was as follows: Tumour bed: 99.4% +/- 2.4%; breast: 98.4% +/- 4.3%; SCN: 99.5% +/- 1.2%; IMC: 96.5% +/- 13.9%. For the VMAT cohort, the coverage was as follows: Tumour bed: 99.7% +/- 0.5%, breast: 99.3% +/- 0.7%; SCN: 99.6% +/- 1.4%; IMC: 99.3% +/- 3%. For ipsilateral lung, Dmean and V20 were 13.6 +/- 1.2 Gy, 21.1% +/- 5% (HT) and 13.6 +/- 1.4 Gy, 20.1% +/- 3.2% (VMAT). Dmean and V30 of the heart were 7.4 +/- 1.4 Gy, 1% +/- 1% (HT) and 10.3 +/- 4.2 Gy, 2.5% +/- 3.9% (VMAT). For controlateral breast Dmean was 3.6 +/- 0.2 Gy (HT) and 4.6 +/- 0.9 Gy (VMAT). Acute skin toxicity grade 3 was 5% in the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: HT and VMAT in complex adjuvant breast irradiation allow a good coverage of target volumes with an acceptable acute tolerance. A longer follow-up is needed to assess the impact of low doses to healthy tissues.PMID: 27648166Title: Enhanced characterization of solid solitary pulmonary nodules with Bayesian analysis-based computer-aided diagnosis.Authors: Perandini S, Soardi GA, Motton M, Augelli R, Dallaserra C, Puntel G, Rossi A, Sala G, Signorini M, Spezia L, Zamboni F, Montemezzi SSource: World J Radiol. 2016 Aug 28;8(8):729-34. doi: 10.4329/wjr.v8.i8.729.Abstract: The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the accuracy gain of Bayesian analysis-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) vs human judgment alone in characterizing solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) at computed tomography (CT). The study included 100 randomly selected SPNs with a definitive diagnosis. Nodule features at first and follow-up CT scans as well as clinical data were evaluated individually on a 1 to 5 points risk chart by 7 radiologists, firstly blinded then aware of Bayesian Inference Malignancy Calculator (BIMC) model predictions. Raters' predictions were evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision analysis. Overall ROC area under the curve was 0.758 before and 0.803 after the disclosure of CAD predictions (P = 0.003). A net gain in diagnostic accuracy was found in 6 out of 7 readers. Mean risk class of benign nodules dropped from 2.48 to 2.29, while mean risk class of malignancies rose from 3.66 to 3.92. Awareness of CAD predictions also determined a significant drop on mean indeterminate SPNs (15 vs 23.86 SPNs) and raised the mean number of correct and confident diagnoses (mean 39.57 vs 25.71 SPNs). This study provides evidence supporting the integration of the Bayesian analysis-based BIMC model in SPN characterization.PMID: 27648140Title: Upregulation of lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in osteosarcoma through activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.Authors: Zhao H, Hou W, Tao J, Zhao Y, Wan G, Ma C, Xu HSource: Am J Transl Res. 2016 Aug 15;8(8):3503-12. eCollection 2016.Abstract: HNF1A-antisense 1 (HNF1A-AS1), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is associated with metastasis and is an independent prognostic factor for lung cancer. Recent studies demonstrated that HNF1A-AS1 play important roles in cacinogenesis. However, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of HNF1A-AS1 in osteosarcoma (OS) progression is still unclear. In the present study, we found that HNF1A-AS1 was markedly up-regulated in OS tissues compared to their adjacent non-tumor tissues. HNF1A-AS1 expression levels were positively associated with the clinical stage, distant metastasis, and reduced overall survival of OS patients. In addition, knockdown HNF1A-AS1 expression inhibited cell proliferation, metastasis and influences the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in OS cells. Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator (LiCl) rescued the anticancer effect of knockdown HNF1A-AS1 expression in OS cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that HNF1A-AS1 promoted the progression of OS via regulating the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, indicating that HNF1A-AS1 might be a potential target for the treatment of OS.PMID: 27648082Title: External beam boost versus interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost in the adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving therapy in early-stage breast cancer: a dosimetric comparison.Authors: Terheyden MM, Melchert C, Kovacs GSource: J Contemp Brachytherapy. 2016 Aug;8(4):294-300. doi: 10.5114/jcb.2016.61973. Epub 2016 Aug 29.Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the dosimetric data of local tumor's bed dose escalation (boost) with photon beams (external beam radiation therapy - EBRT) versus high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-BT) after breast-conserving treatment in women with early-stage breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the treatment planning data of 136 irradiated patients, treated between 2006 and 2013, who underwent breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant whole breast irradiation (WBI; 50.4 Gy) and boost (HDR-BT: 10 Gy in one fraction [n = 36]; EBRT: 10 Gy in five fractions [n = 100]). Organs at risk (OAR; heart, ipsilateral lung, skin, most exposed rib segment) were delineated. Dosimetric parameters were calculated with the aid of dose-volume histograms (DVH). A non-parametric test was performed to compare the two different boost forms. RESULTS: There was no difference for left-sided cancers regarding the maximum dose to the heart (HDR-BT 29.8% vs. EBRT 29.95%, p = 0.34). The maximum doses to the other OAR were significantly lower for HDR-BT (Dmax lung 47.12% vs. 87.7%, p < 0.01; rib 61.17% vs. 98.5%, p < 0.01; skin 57.1% vs. 94.75%, p < 0.01; in the case of right-sided breast irradiation, dose of the heart 6.00% vs. 16.75%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to EBRT, local dose escalation with HDR-BT presented a significant dose reduction to the investigated OAR. Only left-sided irradiation showed no difference regarding the maximum dose to the heart. Reducing irradiation exposure to OAR could result in a reduction of long-term side effects. Therefore, from a dosimetric point of view, an interstitial boost complementary to WBI via EBRT seems to be more advantageous in the adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer.PMID: 27647993Title: Microbiological spectrum of pneumonia in patients with lung cancer.Authors: Tamura T, Satoh HSource: Contemp Oncol (Pozn). 2016;20(3):266. doi: 10.5114/wo.2016.61570.

Epub 2016 Aug 4.Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 play roles in inflammation and autoimmunity. The function of the IL-17/IL-23 pathway has not been completely evaluated in cancer patients. We aimed to investigate serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels and their relationship with clinicopathological and biochemical parameters in lung cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five lung cancer patients and 46 healthy volunteers were included in the study. IL-17 and IL-23 measurements were made with the ELISA method. The ages of patients (53-84 years) and healthy subjects (42-82 years) were similar. RESULTS: Serum IL-23 levels were higher in lung cancer patients than in healthy subjects (491.27 +/-1263.38 pg/ml vs. 240.51 +/-233.18 pg/ml; p = 0.032). IL-23 values were higher in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients than in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (1325.30 +/-2478.06 pg/ml vs. 229.15 +/-103.22 pg/ml; p = 0.043). Serum IL-17 levels were lower in the patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (135.94 +/-52.36 pg/ml vs. 171.33 +/-133.51 pg/ml; p = 0.124). Presence of comorbid disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension or chronic obstructive lung disease) did not have any effect on the levels of IL-17 or IL-23. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate values were positively correlated with cytokine levels, but serum albumin levels were negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-23 levels are elevated in lung cancer patients, particularly those with SCLC. IL-17 and IL-23 values are correlated with inflammatory markers in the patients.PMID: 27647974Title: Endostatin enhances antitumor effect of tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cell therapy in mouse xenograft model of lung carcinoma.Authors: Liang J, Liu X, Xie Q, Chen G, Li X, Jia Y, Yin B, Qu X, Li YSource: Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;28(4):452-60. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.04.09.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antitumor effect of endostatin combined with tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cell (DC)-T cell therapy on lung cancer. METHODS: Transplanted Lewis lung cancer (LLC) models of C57BL/6 mice were established by subcutaneous injection of LLC cells in left extremity axillary. Tumor antigen-pulsed DC-T cells from spleen cells and bone of mice were cultured in vitro. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups, including DC-T+endostatin group, DC-T group, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control group. Microvessel density (MVD) of tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were determined by Western blotting and IHC staining. The proportions of CD8+ T cells, mature dendritic cells (mDC), tumor-associated macrophages [TAM (M1/M2)], and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in suspended cells of tumor tissue were determined by flow cytometry. The expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in suspended cells of tumor tissue were detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: DC-T cells combined with endostatin remarkably suppressed tumor growth. MVD of mice in DC-T+endostatin group was significantly lower than that of the control group and DC-T monotherapy group. The expressions of VEGF, IL-6 and IL-17 in tumors were markedly decreased, but IFN-gamma and HIF-1alpha increased after treating with DC-T cells combined with endostatin, compared to control group and DC-T group. In the DC-T+endostatin group, the proportions of MDSC and TAM (M2 type) were significantly decreased, mDC and TAM (M1 type) were up-regulated, and CD8+ T cells were recruited to infiltrate tumors, in contrast to PBS control and DC-T monotherapy. DC-T cells combined with endostatin potently reduced the expressions of IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta and IL-17 in tumor tissue, and enhanced the expression of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated the synergic antitumor effects between endostatin and tumor antigen-pulsed DC-T cells, which may be a prospective therapy strategy to achieve potent antitumor effects on lung cancer.PMID: 27647973Title: A phase I trial of an oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, chidamide, in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Hu X, Wang L, Lin L, Han X, Dou G, Meng Z, Shi YSource: Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Aug;28(4):444-51. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.04.08.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This phase I study was to evaluate safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of chidamide, a novel subtype-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Ten patients received oral chidamide 20, 25, or 30 mg twice per week continuously with paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) 5 mg/mL/min] administered in a 3-week cycle. Patients with response and stable disease after four cycles maintained chidamide monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis after the first single oral of chidamide and first combination treatment in cycle 1 from all patients. RESULTS: Two dose-limiting toxicities were recorded in the 30 mg cohort, including thrombocytopenia and prolonged neutropenia in the first cycle. Grade 3/4 neutropenia in any cycle was observed in all patients, but was not associated with significant complications. Other grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities included thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. No significant changes were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters for both chidamide and paclitaxel. One patient in the 20 mg cohort had confirmed partial response (PR). Two out of 5 patients with brain metastases had intracranial complete remission after 4-cycle treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Chidamide combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin was generally tolerated without unanticipated toxicities or clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. The recommended dose for chidamide in this combination was established at 20 mg, and a phase II trial is ongoing with this regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC.PMID: 27647909Title: Whole-exome sequencing identifies multiple loss-of-function mutations of NF-kappaB pathway regulators in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Authors: Zheng H, Dai W, Cheung AK, Ko JM, Kan R, Wong BW, Leong MM, Deng M, Kwok TC, Chan JY, Kwong DL, Lee AW, Ng WT, Ngan RK, Yau CC, Tung S, Lee VH, Lam KO, Kwan CK, Li WS, Yau S, Chan KW, Lung MLSource: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 19. pii: 201607606.Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy with a unique geographical distribution. The genomic abnormalities leading to NPC pathogenesis remain unclear. In total, 135 NPC tumors were examined to characterize the mutational landscape using whole-exome sequencing and targeted resequencing. An APOBEC cytidine deaminase mutagenesis signature was revealed in the somatic mutations. Noticeably, multiple loss-of-function mutations were identified in several NF-kappaB signaling negative regulators NFKBIA, CYLD, and TNFAIP3 Functional studies confirmed that inhibition of NFKBIA had a significant impact on NF-kappaB activity and NPC cell growth. The identified loss-of-function mutations in NFKBIA leading to protein truncation contributed to the altered NF-kappaB activity, which is critical for NPC tumorigenesis. In addition, somatic mutations were found in several cancer-relevant pathways, including cell cycle-phase transition, cell death, EBV infection, and viral carcinogenesis. These data provide an enhanced road map for understanding the molecular basis underlying NPC.PMID: 27647900Title: Fluorescent metallacycle-cored polymers via covalent linkage and their use as contrast agents for cell imaging.Authors: Zhang M, Li S, Yan X, Zhou Z, Saha ML, Wang YC, Stang PJSource: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 19. pii: 201612898.Abstract: The covalent linkage of supramolecular monomers provides a powerful strategy for constructing dynamic polymeric materials whose properties can be readily tuned either by the selection of monomers or the choice of functional linkers. In this strategy, the stabilities of the supramolecular monomers and the reactions used to link the monomers are crucial because such monomers are normally dynamic and can disassemble during the linking process, leading to mixture of products. Therefore, although noncovalent interactions have been widely introduced into metallacycle structures to prepare metallosupramolecular polymers, metallacycle-cored polymers linked by covalent bonds have been rarely reported. Herein, we used the mild, highly efficient amidation reaction between alkylamine and N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated carboxylic acid to link the pendent amino functional groups of a rhomboidal metallacycle 10 to give metallacycle-cored polymers P1 and P2, which further yielded nanoparticles at low concentration and transformed into network structures as the concentration increased. Moreover, these polymers exhibited enhanced emission and showed better quantum yields than metallacycle 10 in methanol and methanol/water (1/9, vol/vol) due to the aggregation-induced emission properties of a tetraphenylethene-based pyridyl donor, which serves as a precursor for metallacycle 10. The fluorescence properties of these polymers were further used in cell imaging, and they showed a significant enrichment in lung cells after i.v. injection. Considering the anticancer activity of rhomboidal Pt(II) metallacycles, this type of fluorescent metallacycle-cored polymers can have potential applications toward lung cancer treatment.PMID: 27647775Title: Carotid body resection for sympathetic modulation in systolic heart failure: results from first-in-man study.Authors: Niewinski P, Janczak D, Rucinski A, Tubek S, Engelman ZJ, Piesiak P, Jazwiec P, Banasiak W, Fudim M, Sobotka PA, Javaheri S, Hart EC, Paton JF, Ponikowski PSource: Eur J Heart Fail. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/ejhf.641.Abstract: AIMS: Augmented reflex responses from peripheral chemoreceptors, which are mainly localized in the carotid bodies (CBs), characterize patients with systolic heart failure and contribute to adrenergic hyperactivation. We investigated whether surgical resection of CBs in these patients can be performed safely to decrease sympathetic tone. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 10 male patients with systolic heart failure (age, 59 +/- 3 years; LVEF, 27 +/- 7%) who underwent unilateral right-sided CB resection (four patients) or bilateral CB resection (six patients). Primary endpoints of the study were changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and peripheral chemosensitivity measured as ventilatory response to hypoxia from baseline to 1 month post-CB resection. Safety analysis included analysis of arterial blood gas and oxygenation at night through 2 months post-procedure and adverse events assessed up to 12 months. At the 1-month visit, CB resection was associated with a significant decrease both in MSNA (86.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 79.7 +/- 4.2 bursts/100 beats, P = 0.03) and in peripheral chemosensitivity (1.35 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.17 L/min/SpO2 , P = 0.005). It also resulted in improved exercise tolerance. Amongst some patients with bilateral CB resection, there was a trend towards worsening of oxygen saturation at night, which in one case required therapy with non-invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: We present first-in-man evidence that CB resection in patients with systolic heart failure is associated with a decrease in sympathetic activity. A bilateral procedure may carry a risk of worsening oxygenation at night. CB modulation constitutes an interesting research avenue, but careful consideration of the balance between safety and efficacy is necessary before further clinical trials.PMID: 27647675Title: An unexpected surge in plasma BKPyV viral load heralds the development of BKPyV associated metastatic bladder cancer in a lung transplant recipient with BKPyV nephropathy.Authors: Kuppachi S, Holanda D, Eberlein M, Alexiev B, Tyler AJ, Wissel MC, Kleiboeker SB, Thomas CPSource: Am J Transplant. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1111/ajt.14057.Abstract: We report a lung transplant recipient who developed BK polyoma virus (BKPyV) DNAemia and BKPyV nephropathy. With careful management of his immunosuppression he achieved significant reduction in BKPyV DNAemia and stabilization of his kidney function. He later developed a high-grade bladder cancer and shortly thereafter he experienced a major upsurge in the level of BKPyV DNAemia that coincided with the discovery of hepatic metastasis. Retrospectively, the bladder cancer and the hepatic secondary tumor stained uniformly for SV40 large T antigen (SV40 LTAg), and the BKPyV DNA sequences identified in plasma corresponded to BKPyV DNA within hepatic tissue indicating that the spike in BKPyV load was likely derived from the circulating tumor cells or cell free tumor DNA following metastases of a BKV-associated cancer. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of a surge in BKPyV load in a patient with controlled BKPyVN that heralded the appearance of a metastatic urothelial malignancy. This report discusses the literature on BKPyV-associated malignancies and the possibility that unexplained increases in BKPyV DNAemia may be a biomarker for metastatic BKPyV-related urothelial cancer.

Uncorrected, these may lead to lower tumor dose, but can be corrected for by adaptive radiotherapy (ART). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anatomical changes in 233 patients were monitored online on cone-beam CT-scans used for daily soft-tissue matching. If systematic changes above the pre-defined trigger criteria were observed, a new CT-scan, delineations, and treatment plan were made, restoring the intended dose distribution. Dose distributions with and without adaptation were compared. The first fifty ART patients were given two surveillance CT-scans during radiotherapy. These were used to evaluate delivered dose for patients without adaptation. The first fifty-two patients treated with ART were also compared with 52 pre-ART patients to evaluate the reduction in normal tissue doses. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (27%) were adapted. Seventy-five per cent of all adaptations correctly adjusted for a decrease in tumor dose. Eighty-seven surveillance CT-scans were obtained for the first fifty patients and in only 2% of the cases, a decrease in tumor coverage (DeltaV95%CTV>1%) was observed. With ART we observed a significant decrease in lung dose (MLD reduced from 14.6Gy to 12.6Gy on average). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of soft-tissue match combined with ART decreased the lung dose. The trigger criteria used correctly identified all but one (98%) of the patients requiring adaptation with a false positive rate of 20%.PMID: 27647404Title: [Relationship between treatment-related hypertension and therapeutic efficacy of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma].Authors: Song Y, Du CX, Zhang W, Sun YK, Yang L, Cui CX, Chi Y, Zhou AP, Wang JW, Sun YSource: Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 23;38(9):698-702. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2016.09.012.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are widely used for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between treatment-related hypertension and the therapeutic efficacy of VEGFR-TKIs. METHODS: Clinical data of 155 mRCC patients treated with VEGFR-TKIs at the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from 2006 to 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received first-line TKI therapy. Among them, 69 patients were treated with sunitinib, 14 cases with pazopanib, and 51 cases with fazotinib. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the survival of the patients. RESULTS: The median survival for the whole group (n=155) was 36.2 months. Among the 98 (63.2%) patients who developed hypertension, 9 patients (5.8%) were evaluated as grade , 54 (34.8%) as grade and 35 (22.6%) as grade , and there was no patient with grade hypertension. The occurrence of TKI-related hypertension was correlated with age and MSKCC score (P<0.05), while not significantly correlated with gender, nephrectomy, T stage, number of metastases, lung metastasis or sunitinib treatment (P>0.05 for all). For the whole group (n=155), the therapeutic efficacy rate was 43.2% (67/155), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.0 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 36.2 months. The response rate (RR) was 26.3% (15/57) in patients with normal blood pressure and 53.1% (52/98) in patients with hypertension (P=0.001). The median PFS was 7.1 months in the cases with normal blood pressure and 13.8 months in patients with hypertension (P=0.032). The response rates were 33.3% (3/9), 51.9% (28/54) and 60.0% (21/35) in patients with grade , and hypertension (P=0.006). The median PFS was 7.1, 9.7, and 12.0 and 19.5 months in patients with normal blood pressure, and patients with grade , and hypertension, respectively (P=0.039). Both univariant and multivariant analyses indicated that treatment-related hypertension is an important predictive factor for the efficacy of VEGFR-TKIs therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension might be an effective predictive factor for efficacy of VEGFR-TKIs therapy in mRCC patients. Large-sample studies are warranted to further prove these results.PMID: 27647400Title: [Clinical value of classified detection of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood of NSCLC patients].Authors: Yin HL, Yin J, Chen LW, Li N, Liu ZA, Hu ZB, Shen HBSource: Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 23;38(9):677-81. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2016.09.008.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical value of detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) classified by epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in peripheral blood of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Peripheral blood samples (7.5 ml each time) were collected from 47 NSCLC patients. Among them, blood samples were collected at the end of each therapy-cycle in three patients for longitudinal monitoring of CTCs. CTCs were enriched by the depletion of leucocytes using a magnetic bead separation technique, stained with EpCAM, cytokeratin 7/8 and their isotypic control antibodies, respectively, and then identified and counted by multi-parameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the blood samples from 47 patients, EpCAM-positive CTCs were detected in 64.3%(9/14), 40.0%(4/10) and 43.5%(10/23) of patients in stages -, and , respectively. EpCAM-negative CTCs were detected in 78.6%(11/14), 90.0%(9/10) and 91.3%(21/23) of patients in stage -, , and , respectively. The total detection rates of EpCAM-positive and EpCAM-negative CTCs were 48.9%(23/47) and 87.2%(41/47), respectively, showing a statistically significant difference between them (P<0.001). According to the stage of the cancer, there was a significant difference between the detection rates of the two types of CTCs in patients of stage (P=0.001), but not in stage - and (P>0.05). The number of EpCAM-negative CTCs was significantly higher than that of EpCAM-positive CTCs in all stages (P<0.05). The frequency of patients with the percentage of EpCAM-negative CTCs >90% was significantly higher in stage patients than that in stage - cases (P=0.030), while the frequency of patients with the percentage of EpCAM-negative CTCs between 50%~90% was significantly lower in the stage than that in the stage - patients (P=0.001). The treatment of most patients with EpCAM-negative CTCs >50% showed to be ineffective (P=0.033). CONCLUSION: Detection of CTCs classified by EpCAM in peripheral blood is helpful in evaluating the distant metastasis and treatment effectiveness of NSCLC patients.PMID: 27647299Title: Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility in the Community: Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Coronary Artery Calcification, and Cardiovascular Events.Authors: Lu MT, Onuma OK, Massaro JM, D'Agostino RB Sr, O'Donnell CJ, Hoffmann USource: Circulation. 2016 Sep 20;134(12):897-9. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023957.Abstract: ?PMID: 27647228Title: Posttransplant solid organ malignancies in lung transplant recipients: a single-center experience and review of the literature.Authors: Bennett D, Fossi A, Refini RM, Gentili F, Luzzi L, Voltolini L, Paladini P, Mazzei MA, Rottoli PSource: Tumori. 2016 Aug 23:0. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000557.Abstract: PURPOSE: Solid-organ tumor incidences are higher in solid organ transplant patients than in the general population. The aim of this study was to analyze solid-organ tumor frequency and characteristics in a population of lung transplant patients and provide a brief review of the literature. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients who underwent a lung transplant in the Lung Transplant Program at the University Hospital of Siena, Italy, from 2001 to 2014 (n = 119). Patients' demographics, pretransplant characteristics, immunosuppressive therapy, and infectious factors were recorded. RESULTS: Nine patients with a median age of 59.0 years (range 50-63) of our cohort developed a solid-organ tumor (7.5%). Most of the patients experienced nonmelanoma skin cancer (44.4%); the others were diagnosed with lung cancer (22.2%), breast cancer (22.2%), and colon-rectal cancer (11.2%). The median time from transplantation to tumor diagnosis was 895.0 days (range 321-2046). No differences in pretransplant characteristics, immunosuppressive therapy, or infectious factors were found between patients who developed solid organ tumors and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that de novo malignancies are a major issue in lung transplant patients; in particular, skin and lung cancers demonstrated a higher incidence rate. Oncologic treatment of these patients is complex, requiring close collaboration between the transplant team and oncologist. Strict screening programs are key factors for an early diagnosis and to allow for prompt treatment resulting in a better outcome.PMID: 27647063Title: CHARTing a Path to Pragmatic Tobacco Treatment Research.Authors: Cruvinel E, Richter KP, Stoney C, Duffy S, Fellows J, Harrington KF, Rigotti NA, Sherman S, Tindle HA, Shireman TI, Shelley D, Waiwaiole L, Cummins SSource: Am J Prev Med. 2016 Oct;51(4):630-6. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2016.05.025.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: It is important to consider the degree to which studies are explanatory versus pragmatic to understand the implications of their findings for patients, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Pragmatic trials test the effectiveness of interventions in real-world conditions; explanatory trials test for efficacy under ideal conditions. The Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco (CHART) is a network of seven NIH-funded trials designed to identify effective programs that can be widely implemented in routine clinical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of CHART trial study designs was conducted to place each study on the pragmatic-explanatory continuum. After reliability training, six raters independently scored each CHART study according to ten PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) dimensions, which covered participant eligibility criteria, intervention flexibility, practitioner expertise, follow-up procedures, participant compliance, practitioner adherence, and outcome analyses. Means and SDs were calculated for each dimension of each study, with lower scores representing more pragmatic elements. Results were plotted on "spoke and wheel" diagrams. The rating process and analyses were performed in October 2014 to September 2015. RESULTS: All seven CHART trials tended toward the pragmatic end of the spectrum, although there was a range from 0.76 (SD=0.23) to 1.85 (SD=0.58). Most studies included some explanatory design elements. CONCLUSIONS: CHART findings should be relatively applicable to clinical practice.

The goal of this study was to characterize enrollment trends and disparities by age, sex, and race/ethnicity in lung cancer trials. METHODS: We analyzed data for 23,006 National Cancer Institute cooperative group lung cancer trial participants and 578,476 patients with lung cancer from the SEER registry from 1990 to 2012. The enrollment disparity difference (EDD) and enrollment disparity ratio (EDR) were calculated on the basis of the proportion of each subgroup in the trial population and the US lung cancer population. Annual percentage changes (APCs) in the subgroup proportions in each population were compared over time. RESULTS: Enrollment disparity for patients >/= 70 years of age with non-small-cell lung cancer improved from 1990 to 2012 (test of parallelism, P = .020), with a remaining EDD of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.25) and EDR of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.51 to 1.82) in 2010 to 2012. No improvement was seen for elderly patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), with an APC of 0.20 (P = .714) among trial participants, despite a rising proportion of elderly patients with SCLC in the US population (APC, 0.32; P = .020). Enrollment disparity for women with lung cancer improved overall, with the gap closing by 2012 (EDD, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.06]; EDR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.16]). Enrollment disparities persisted without significant improvement for elderly women, blacks, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. CONCLUSION: Under-representation in lung cancer trials improved significantly from 1990 to 2012 for elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and for women, but ongoing efforts to improve the enrollment of elderly patients with SCLC and minorities are needed. Our study highlights the importance of addressing enrollment disparities by demographic and disease subgroups to better target under-represented groups of patients with lung cancer.PMID: 27646942Title: Pneumonitis in Patients Treated With Anti-Programmed Death-1/Programmed Death Ligand 1 Therapy.Authors: Naidoo J, Wang X, Woo KM, Iyriboz T, Halpenny D, Cunningham J, Chaft JE, Segal NH, Callahan MK, Lesokhin AM, Rosenberg J, Voss M, Rudin CM, Rizvi H, Hou X, Rodriguez K, Albano M, Gordon RA, Leduc C, Rekhtman N, Harris B, Menzies AM, Guminski AD, Carlino MS, Kong BY, Wolchok JD, Postow MA, Long GV, Hellmann MDSource: J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 19. pii: JCO682005.Abstract: PURPOSE: Pneumonitis is an uncommon but potentially fatal toxicity of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features are poorly described. METHODS: Patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 mAb were identified at two institutions (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: advanced solid cancers, 2009 to 2014, and Melanoma Institute of Australia: melanomas only, 2013 to 2015). Pneumonitis was diagnosed by the treating investigator; cases with confirmed malignant lung infiltration or infection were excluded. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of pneumonitis were collected. Associations among pneumonitis incidence, therapy received, and underlying malignancy were examined with Fisher's exact test as were associations between pneumonitis features and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 915 patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, pneumonitis developed in 43 (5%; 95% CI, 3% to 6%; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 27 of 578 [5%]; Melanoma Institute of Australia, 16 of 337 [5%]). Time to onset of pneumonitis ranged from 9 days to 19.2 months. The incidence of pneumonitis was higher with combination immunotherapy versus monotherapy (19 of 199 [10%] v 24 of 716 [3%]; P < .01). Incidence was similar in patients with melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (overall, 26 of 532 [5%] v nine of 209 [4%]; monotherapy, 15 of 417 v five of 152 [P = 1.0]; combination, 11 of 115 v four of 57 [P = .78]). Seventy-two percent (31 of 43) of cases were grade 1 to 2, and 86% (37 of 43) improved/resolved with drug holding/immunosuppression. Five patients worsened clinically and died during the course of pneumonitis treatment; proximal cause of death was pneumonitis (n = 1), infection related to immunosuppression (n = 3), or progressive cancer (n = 1). Radiologic and pathologic features of pneumonitis were diverse. CONCLUSION: Pneumonitis associated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs is a toxicity of variable onset and clinical, radiologic, and pathologic appearances. It is more common when anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs are combined with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 mAb. Most events are low grade and improve/resolve with drug holding/immunosuppression. Rarely, pneumonitis worsens despite immunosuppression, and may result in infection and/or death.PMID: 27646906Title: [Pleural invasion in lung cancer: diagnosis and research progress].Authors: Chen TY, Jin RR, Hua HJ, Xu C, Zhang ZHSource: Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 8;45(9):666-70. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.09.022.Abstract: ?PMID: 27646905Title: [Development of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in non-small cell lung cancer].Authors: Xu C, Hua HJ, Chen TY, Pan BJ, Zhang ZHSource: Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 8;45(9):663-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.09.021.Abstract: ?PMID: 27646895Title: [Expression of ALK with clinicopathologic features in lung cancer using biopsy specimens].Authors: Tang R, Guo L, Liu XY, Li WB, Ying JMSource: Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 8;45(9):642-3. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.09.011.Abstract: ?PMID: 27646888Title: [Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation specific antibodies in lung adenocarcinoma: evaluation of sensitivity, specificity and relationship to histologic subtypes].Authors: Lai YM, Feng Q, Sun Y, Wang P, Shi YF, Zhao M, Wu Q, Li XHSource: Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Sep 8;45(9):606-11. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.09.004.Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation specific antibodies in invasive lung adenocarcinomas, and their sensitivity, specificity, as well as relationship to histological subtypes. METHODS: Immunostaining with EGFR mutation-specific antibodies, del E746-A750 in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21, was performed in tissue microarrays of 884 cases of resection specimens to study the relationship between the immunophenotypes and morphologic subtypes. The sensitivity and specificity of the stains were compared with gene mutations detected by amplified refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 884 cases, the expression of del E746-A750 in exon 19 was 3+ , 2+ , 1+ and 0 in 7 cases (0.79%), 38 cases (4.30%), 129 cases (14.59%) and 710 cases (80.32%), respectively. For L858R in exon 21, 3+ , 2+ , 1+ and 0 staining were seen in 82 cases (9.28%), 93 cases (10.52%), 82 cases (9.28%) and 627 cases (70.93%), respectively. For both antibodies, positive expression (1+ or more) was mainly observed in lepidic, acinar and papillary predominant subtypes, and rarely seen in solid subtype or invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (P=0.014 and 0.016). If 1+ to 3+ expression was set as positive, the specificity of exon 19/exon 21 reached 98.59%/92.98%, while the sensitivity was relatively lower (62.86%/88.89%). If 2+ to 3+ expression was read as positive, the specificity and sensitivity were 99.30%/97.37% and 25.71%/74.60% for exon 19/exon 21. If only 3+ expression was considered positive, the specificity was 100.0% for both antibodies, with a low sensitivity (8.57% for exon 19 and 34.92% for exon 21). Of the 18 cases with E746-A750 del in exon 19 based on molecular detection, the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry for exon 19 was 88.89% if a positive cutoff value >/=1+ was used; in contrast, of the 8 cases harboring other deletions in exon 19, only two cases were positive as 1+ . CONCLUSIONS: Both the EGFR mutation specific antibodies del E746-A750 in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21 demonstrate high specificity and relatively low sensitivity, and are mostly expressed in lepidic, acinar and papillary predominant subtypes, but rarely in solid subtype or invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. For cases with 3+ expression, a mutational statue for EGFR is likely. For the 2+ positive cases, the accuracy to predict mutation almost reaches 90%, but molecular detection for confirmation is desirable. For the 1+ and negative cases, DNA-based test is essential to avoid false negativity.PMID: 27646803Title: Society of Behavioral Medicine supports implementation of high quality lung cancer screening in high-risk populations.Authors: Watson KS, Blok AC, Buscemi J, Molina Y, Fitzgibbon M, Simon MA, Williams L, Matthews K, Studts JL, Lillie SE, Ostroff JS, Carter-Harris L, Winn RASource: Transl Behav Med. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) supports the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening of the chest for eligible populations to reduce lung cancer mortality. Consistent with efforts to translate research findings into real-world settings, SBM encourages health-care providers and health-care systems to (1) integrate evidence-based tobacco treatment as an essential component of LDCT-based lung cancer screening, (2) examine the structural barriers that may impact screening uptake, and (3) incorporate shared decision-making as a clinical platform to facilitate consultations and engagement with individuals at high risk for lung cancer about the potential benefits and harms associated with participation in a lung cancer screening program. We advise policy makers and legislators to support screening in high-risk populations by continuing to (1) expand access to high quality LDCT-based screening among underserved high-risk populations, (2) enhance cost-effectiveness by integrating evidence-based tobacco treatments into screening in high-risk populations, and (3) increase funding for research that explores implementation science and increased public awareness and access of diverse populations to participate in clinical and translational research.PMID: 27646734Title: Multiregion sequencing reveals the intratumor heterogeneity of driver mutations in TP53-driven non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Zhang LL, Kan M, Zhang MM, Yu SS, Xie HJ, Gu ZH, Wang HN, Zhao SX, Zhou GB, Song HD, Zheng CXSource: Int J Cancer. 2016 Sep 20. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30437.Abstract: Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may account for resistance after a period of targeted therapies because drugs destroy only a portion of tumor cells. The recognition of ITH helps identify high-risk patients to make effective treatment decisions. However, ITH studies are confounded by interpatient heterogeneity in NSCLC and a large amount of passenger mutations. To address these issues, we recruited NSCLC patients carrying TP53 mutations and selected driver mutations within recurrently mutated genes in NSCLC. A total of 12-paired normal-tumor tissues were subjected to whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing. From these, 367 non-silent mutations were selected as driver mutations and deeply sequenced in 61 intratumoral microdissections. We identified a universal prevalence of heterogeneity in all 12 tumors, indicating branched evolution. Although TP53 mutations were observed in single biopsy of all 12 tumors, most tumors consist of both TP53 mutated and non-mutated cells in separate regions within the same tumor. This suggests the late molecular timing of the acquisition of TP53 mutations; therefore, the detection of TP53 mutations in a single biopsy may simply not reflect the early malignant potential. Additionally, we identified regions of loss of heterozygosity surrounding TP53 and CDKN2A mutations in tumor 711, which also exhibited heterogeneity in different regional samples. Because the ITH of driver mutations likely has clinical consequences, further efforts are needed to limit the impact of ITH and to improve therapeutic efficiency, which will benefit NSCLC patients receiving targeted treatments.

We describe the clinical features of two patients with this double anomaly. CASE REPORTS: A 62-year-old Caucasian non-smoking woman was diagnosed with cT4N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement. She received cisplatin-gemcitabine, followed by 17 months of gemcitabine. Owing to progression, she received erlotinib for 14 months, then paclitaxel for 6 months and finally crizotinib. A partial response was achieved and maintained for 24 months. A 45-year-old Caucasian woman, light smoker, was diagnosed with cT2N3M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Only EGFR mutation was found on initial analysis. She underwent treatment with cisplatin-gemcitabine and thoracic radiotherapy. Progression occurred after 8 months and afatinbib was started. Eight months later, progression was observed with a neoplasic pleural effusion in which tumor cells expressing ALK rearrangement were found. A new FISH analysis was performed on the initial tumor but did not find this rearrangement. Despite a third line of crizotinib, the patient died one month later. DISCUSSION: The literature shows 45 other cases of these two abnormalities, observed either from the start or during follow-up. EGFR's TKI were almost always given before ALK's TKI. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic strategy needs to be clarified in cases of double alteration. With regard to the second patient, appearance of ALK rearrangement may constitute a resistance mechanism to EGFR's TKI.PMID: 27646564Title: RET kinase inhibitors: a review of recent patents (2012-2015).Authors: Mologni L, Gambacorti-Passerini C, Goekjian P, Scapozza LSource: Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinases are involved in the control of several biological processes and have been recognized as hot spots of oncogenic transformation, thus representing a major therapeutic target. Dysregulated activation of RET kinase, either through point mutations or gene fusions, is accountable for a significant fraction of thyroid carcinomas, as well as a minor population of lung cancers. Two drugs are currently available for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma and two additional compounds have been approved for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Several other molecules are under preclinical and clinical evaluation. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the most recent patent literature (2012-2015) describing compounds with activity against the RET kinase, trying to catch a view of the next generation of potential anti-RET drugs. EXPERT OPINION: RET has been a focus of molecularly targeted efforts for over a decade. However, none of the drugs currently on the clinical stage were specifically developed to hit RET, which was rather an off-target. Besides, only two of four drugs have activity on metastatic medullary carcinoma. Therefore, there is still a need of additional, more potent and more specific RET inhibitors, which will hopefully emerge from the new generation of compounds disclosed in most recent patents.PMID: 27646525Title: Significance of coexistent granulomatous inflammation and lung cancer.Authors: Dagaonkar RS, Choong CV, Asmat AB, Ahmed DB, Chopra A, Lim AY, Tai DY, Kor AC, Goh SK, Abisheganaden J, Verma ASource: J Clin Pathol. 2016 Sep 19. pii: jclinpath-2016-203868. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203868.Abstract: AIMS: Coexistence of lung cancer and granulomatous inflammation in the same patient confuses clinicians. We aimed to document the prevalence, clinicopathological features, treatment outcomes and prognosis in patients with coexisting granulomatous inflammation undergoing curative lung resection for lung cancer, in a tuberculosis (TB)-endemic country. METHODS: An observational cohort study of patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection between 2012 and 2015 in a tertiary centre in Singapore. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients underwent lung resection for cancer, out of which 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen. Median age was 68 years and 58.2% were males. Overall median (range) survival was 451 (22-2452) days. Eighteen (14%) patients died at median duration of 271 days after surgery. The postsurgery median survival for those alive was 494 (29-2452) days in the whole group. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any differences in age, gender, location of cancer, radiological features, type of cancer, chemotherapy, history of TB or survival in patients with or without coexistent granulomatous inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental detection of granulomatous inflammation in patients undergoing lung resection for cancer, even in a TB-endemic country, may not require any intervention. Such findings may be due to either mycobacterial infection in the past or 'sarcoid reaction' to cancer. Although all patients should have their resected specimen sent for acid-fast bacilli culture and followed up until the culture results are reported, the initiation of the management of such patients as per existing lung cancer management guidelines does not affect their outcome adversely.PMID: 27645938Title: Regarding American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Quality of Care Measure 10RLN.Authors: Handy JR Jr, Costas K, Nisco S, Schaerf R, Vallieres E, Hussain SX, Konieczny K, Weerasinghe R, Betzer C, Lothrop KSource: Ann Thorac Surg. 2016 Oct;102(4):1040-1. doi: 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.06.020.Abstract: ?PMID: 27645823Title: A Combination of a Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (PAPVC) and a Lung Tumor Requiring Pulmonary Resection.Authors: Kawagoe I, Hayashida M, Nozumi Y, Banno T, Hirayama S, Suzuki K, Satoh D, Naito Y, Inada ESource: J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2016 Jun 8. pii: S1053-0770(16)30183-5. doi: 10.1053/j.jvca.2016.06.011.Abstract: ?PMID: 27645803Title: Defining a Radiomic Response Phenotype: A Pilot Study using targeted therapy in NSCLC.Authors: Aerts HJ, Grossmann P, Tan Y, Oxnard GG, Rizvi N, Schwartz LH, Zhao BSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 20;6:33860. doi: 10.1038/srep33860.Abstract: Medical imaging plays a fundamental role in oncology and drug development, by providing a non-invasive method to visualize tumor phenotype. Radiomics can quantify this phenotype comprehensively by applying image-characterization algorithms, and may provide important information beyond tumor size or burden. In this study, we investigated if radiomics can identify a gefitinib response-phenotype, studying high-resolution computed-tomography (CT) imaging of forty-seven patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer before and after three weeks of therapy. On the baseline-scan, radiomic-feature Laws-Energy was significantly predictive for EGFR-mutation status (AUC = 0.67, p = 0.03), while volume (AUC = 0.59, p = 0.27) and diameter (AUC = 0.56, p = 0.46) were not. Although no features were predictive on the post-treatment scan (p > 0.08), the change in features between the two scans was strongly predictive (significant feature AUC-range = 0.74-0.91). A technical validation revealed that the associated features were also highly stable for test-retest (mean +/- std: ICC = 0.96 +/- 0.06). This pilot study shows that radiomic data before treatment is able to predict mutation status and associated gefitinib response non-invasively, demonstrating the potential of radiomics-based phenotyping to improve the stratification and response assessment between tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sensitive and resistant patient populations.PMID: 27645692Title: Metabolic tumor volume predicts overall survival and local control in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated in ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235.Authors: Bazan JG, Duan F, Snyder BS, Horng D, Graves EE, Siegel BA, Machtay M, Loo BW JrSource: Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether higher pre-treatment metabolic tumor volume (tMTV-pre) is associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with inoperable NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation (CRT). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6668/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0235 trial. Pre-treatment PET scans were performed on ACRIN-qualified scanners. Computer-aided MTV measurement was performed using RT_Image. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between tMTV and OS. RESULTS: Of the 250 patients enrolled on the study, 230 were evaluable for tMTV-pre. Patients with MTV-pre >32 mL (median value) vs. </=32 mL had worse median OS (14.8 vs. 29.7 months, p < 0.001). As a continuous variable, higher tMTV-pre (per 10-mL increase) remained associated with worse OS (HR = 1.03, p < 0.001) after controlling for other variables. A significant interaction between radiation dose and tMTV-pre occurred for OS (p = 0.002), demonstrating that the negative prognostic impact of tMTV-pre decreased as radiotherapy dose increased. Among patients with tMTV-pre </=32 mL, there was no difference in survival according to radiotherapy dose delivered (p = 0.694). However, median OS was inferior in patients with tMTV-pre >32 mL who received </=60 Gy compared with those who received 61-69 Gy or >/=70 Gy (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher tMTV-pre is associated with significantly worse OS in inoperable stage III NSCLC treated with definitive CRT. Our findings suggest that for patients with large tMTV-pre, achieving a therapeutic radiation dose may help maximize OS. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.PMID: 27645580Title: Inferences of drug responses in cancer cells from cancer genomic features and compound chemical and therapeutic properties.Authors: Wang Y, Fang J, Chen SSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 20;6:32679. doi: 10.1038/srep32679.Abstract: Accurately predicting the response of a cancer patient to a therapeutic agent is a core goal of precision medicine. Existing approaches were mainly relied primarily on genomic alterations in cancer cells that have been treated with different drugs. Here we focus on predicting drug response based on integration of the heterogeneously pharmacogenomics data from both cell and drug sides. Through a systematical approach, named as PDRCC (Predict Drug Response in Cancer Cells), the cancer genomic alterations and compound chemical and therapeutic properties were incorporated to determine the chemotherapeutic response in cancer patients. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) study as the benchmark dataset, all pharmacogenomics data exhibited their roles in inferring the relationships between cancer cells and drugs. When integrating both genomic resources and compound information, the prediction coverage was significantly increased. The validity of PDRCC was also supported by its effective in uncovering the unknown cell-drug associations with database and literature evidences. It set the stage for clinical testing of novel therapeutic strategies, such as the sensitive association between cancer cell 'A549_LUNG' and compound 'Topotecan'. In conclusion, PDRCC offers the possibility for faster, safer, and cheaper the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics in the early-stage clinical trails.PMID: 27645536Title: Ambient PM2.5 Exposure and Mortality Due to Lung Cancer and Cardiopulmonary Diseases in Polish Cities.Authors: Badyda AJ, Grellier J, Dabrowiecki PSource: Adv Exp Med Biol. 2016 Sep 20.Abstract: Air pollution, one of ten most important causes of premature mortality worldwide, remains a major issue also in the EU, with more than 400,000 premature deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 reported yearly. The issue is particularly significant in Poland, where there is the highest concentration of PM2.5 among the UE countries. This study focused on the proportion of mortality due to lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases attributable to PM2.5 in eleven biggest Polish cities in the years 2006-2011. The findings demonstrate that the mean annual concentration of PM2.5 varied from 14.3 to 52.5 mug/m3. The average population attributable fractions varied from 0.195 to 0.413 in case of lung cancer and from 0.130 to 0.291 for cardiopulmonary diseases. Such substantial values of this ratio translate into a considerable number of deaths, which ranged between 9.6 and 22.8 cases for lung cancer and 48.6 to 136.6 cases for cardiopulmonary diseases per 100,000 inhabitants. We conclude that the impact of PM2.5 concentration on the incidence of premature deaths is unduly high in Polish cities.PMID: 27645308Title: Revealing the effect of 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol and curcumin on mPGES-1, GSK-3beta and beta-catenin pathway in A549 cell line.Authors: Eren D, Betul YMSource: Chem Biol Interact. 2016 Sep 16. pii: S0009-2797(16)30373-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2016.09.012.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: In our study, anticancer effects of 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol from ginger and curcumin from turmeric were investigated and the results were compared with each other. We aimed to reveal their effects on microsomal prostaglandine E2 synthase 1 (mPGES-1) which is related with cancer progression and inflammation as well as beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) that are the main components of Wnt/GSK3 pathway. As it is known activation of GSK-3beta and high levels of mPGES-1 pathway leads to cell proliferation and aggravates cancer progression. Therefore both of them are potential targets for cancer therapy. 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol' s effect on this pathway is not known very well up to now while curcumin that is known as an mPGES-1 inhitibor has anticancer properties via this pathway and many other pathways. Besides being in Zingiberaceae family, ginger's 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol have a molecular similarity with turmeric's curcumin. In our study we investigated their effects using a popular non small lung cancer cell line named A549 which expresses mPGES-1 and has active GSK3beta pathway. IL-1beta was used for inducing mPGES-1 and enabling the cancer characteristicscharacteristiscs such as cell proliferation. So compunds that inactivates or decreases the level of these components might be potential anticancer agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 cells were incubated with interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) for 24 h in order to maintain mPGES-1 enzyme induction. Experiments were performed both on IL-1beta and non-IL-1beta group. Real time cell analysis was performed to determine the cytotoxicity. Samples for western blotting and RT-PCR were collected after 24 h incubation with compounds to determine the amount of mPGES-1, GSK-3beta, p-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin protein and mRNA. PGE2 which is the end product of mPGES-1 was measured by using ELISA kit. RESULTS: As a result of cell profile assay, cells exposed to IL-1beta proliferate faster than non-IL-1beta ones. This shows that induced mPGES-1 might play a role through GSK3beta pathway and 24 h IC50 value of 6-shogaol is 62 muM. IL-1beta increased protein and mRNA levels of mPGES-1, p-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin and GSK-3beta in control group. Effects of curcumin and 6-shogaol on these parameters were against IL-1beta's effect while 6-gingerol was not effective at all. Furthermore, 6-shogaol and curcumin might be effective on GSK3beta pathway via lowering PGE2 levels. CONCLUSION: We saw that 6-shogaol is as effective as curcumin on this pathway and our study shows that 6-shogaol might show its anticancer properties via mPGES-1 and GSK3beta pathway. May be these results might used for designing in vivo studies in future.PMID: 27644925Title: [Results of the video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy at our department in the last five-year periode].Authors: Furak J, Pecsy B, Ottlakan A, Nemeth T, Geczi T, Tiszlavicz L, Lakatos A, Lazar GSource: Magy Seb. 2016 Sep;69(3):100-4. doi: 10.1556/1046.69.2016.3.2.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Herein we present the results of lobectomies performed with minimally invasive approach (video-assisted thoracic surgery - VATS) at our department during a period of five years. METHODS: Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015, 197 lobectomies (malignant lesions: 176 cases, benign lesions: 21 cases) were performed by three thoracic surgeons and one resident. Demographical data are as follows: 119 female/78 male, mean age: 62.4 years (range: 41-82 years). In 2011 three VATS lobectomies were performed, equaling 2.2 % of all lobectomies in that year. During the upcomig years the number of VATS lobectomies were as follows: 2012: 7 (7.3%), 2013: 13 (12%), 2014: 59 (34.5%) and 2015: 119 (68.5%). In 153 cases multiportal (78%) and in 44 cases uniportal (22%) anterior approach was performed. The resected lobes showed the following distribution: right upper: 85, mid lobe: 5, right lower: 28, left upper: 44, left lower: 34, upper bilobectomy: 1. In two cases sleeve lobectomy was performed. In 8 cases (4%) conversion to thoracotomy was needed and among the 46 uniportal procedures, 5 cases needed to be expanded into biportal approach (11%). RESULTS: During the study period, no intraoperative, or perioperative mortality occured. Mean operative time was 123 minutes (range: 60-135 minutes) and mean time of chest drainage was 4.3 days (range: 1-27 days). Air leakage lasting more than 7 days was present in 11.7%. Reoperation was needed in 4 cases (2%), in two cases due to bleeding, and in two cases because of expansive difficulties due to extended subcutaneous emphysema. Among the 176 VATS lobectomies performed due to malignant lesions, 169 lung cancers and 7 metastases were removed. The distribution according to the stage and histology of lung cancers was as follows: IA: 100 cases, IB: 28 cases, IIA: 17 cases, IIB: 3 cases, IIIA: 16 cases, IIIB: 1 case, and IV: 4 cases; adenocarcinoma: 128 cases, squamous cell carcinoma: 26 cases, large cell carcinoma: 3 cases, small cell lung cancer: 1 case, typical carcinoid: 10 cases, and atypical carcinoid: 1 case. CONCLUSIONS: Over the years VATS lobectomy became a rutin procedure at our institution. Nowadays more than two-thirds of lobectomies are performed with minimally invasive technique. Taking the learning curve of the four thoracic surgeons into consideration, our results correlate with international data.PMID: 27644880Title: IL-33 signaling fuels outgrowth and metastasis of human lung cancer.Authors: Wang C, Chen Z, Bu X, Han Y, Shan S, Ren T, Song WSource: Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2016 Sep 16. pii: S0006-291X(16)31541-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.081.Abstract: IL-33 is a member of IL-1 superfamily that drives production of Th2-related cytokines. Recently, accumulating evidence suggest an involvement of IL-33 in carcinogenesis. Herein, we determine a close correlation of IL-33 expression and cancer progress in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of IL-33 by transfection with IL-33 expression vector enhances NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis, while genetic knockdown of IL-33 by transfection with IL-33 shRNA limits NSCLC progression. In consistent, IL-33 stimulation of NSCLC cells leads to robust NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, IL-33-triggered NSCLC progression relies on ST2 receptor and thus could be abrogated by ST2 blockade. IL-33/ST2 pathway up-regulates membrane glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) on NSCLC cells, enhancing their glucose uptake and glycolysis. Accordingly, interfering GLUT1 expression dampens IL-33-enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis in NSCLC cells, thereby abrogates IL-33-induced NSCLC outgrowth and metastasis. In essence, these findings derived from patients' freshly isolated NSCLC cells uncover a new function of IL-33 in NSCLC pathogenesis and identify GLUT1 as a novel target of IL-33 signaling. Block IL-33 is a promising therapeutic strategy to limit NSCLC glycolysis and tumor progression in clinical practice.PMID: 27644694Title: New water-soluble palladium(II) complexes of lidocaine and phenylcyanamide derivative ligands: cytotoxicity and cellular response mechanisms.Authors: Tabrizi L, Chiniforoshan HSource: Invest New Drugs. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Three new palladium(II) complexes of lidocaine and phenylcyanamide derivative ligands of formula K[Pd(2,6-Me2pcyd)2(LC)], 1, K[Pd(2,6-Et2pcyd)2(LC)], 2, K[Pd(2,6-Cl2pcyd)2(LC)], 3 (LC: lidocaine, 2,6-Me2pcyd: 2,6-dimethyl phenylcyanamide, 2,6-Et2pcyd: 2,6-diethyl phenylcyanamide, 2,6-Cl2pcyd: 2,6-dichloro phenylcyanamide) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The complexes 1-3 revealed a significant in vitro antiproliferative activity against human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), breast (MCF-7), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cancer cell lines. All the complexes are more active than cisplatin and follow the trend 2 > 1 > 3. Mechanistic studies showed that the trend in cytotoxicity of the Pd(II) complexes is mainly consistent with their ability to accumulate into cancer cells and to increase intracellular basal reactive oxygen species levels, which consequently results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis induction.PMID: 27644662Title: CYP2E1 rs2031920, COMT rs4680 Polymorphisms, Cigarette Smoking, Alcohol Use and Lung Cancer Risk in a Japanese Population.Authors: Kakino K, Kiyohara C, Horiuchi T, Nakanishi YSource: Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):4063-70.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes may contribute to susceptibility to lung cancer because of their critical involvement in mechanisms of carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the role of CYP2E1 rs2031920 and COMT rs4680 in a case-control study involving 462 lung cancer cases and 379 controls in Japanese. Logistic regression was used to assess adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Multiplicative and additive interactions with cigarette smoking or alcohol use were also examined. RESULTS: Neither CYP2E1 rs2031920 nor COMT rs4680 was associated with lung cancer risk overall. However, smokers with the CC genotype of CYP2E1 rs2031920 (OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 2.26-5.63) presented a higher risk of lung cancer than those with at least one T allele (OR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.70-4.98) as compared to never-smokers with at least one T allele (reference). Subjects with excessive drinking and the CC genotype of CYP2E1 rs2031920 had a significantly higher risk (OR=2.22, 95% CI =1.39-3.56) than appropriate drinkers with at least one T allele. A similar tendency was observed between COMT rs4680 and either smoking or drinking habits. There were no multiplicative or additive interactions between the polymorphisms and either smoking or alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CYP2E1 rs2031920 and COMT rs4680 are not major contributors to lung cancer risk in our Japanese population. Future studies on the genetics of lung cancer in Japanese and their environment interactions are required.PMID: 27644622Title: Clinicopathological Characteristics of Iranian Patients with Lung Cancer: a Single Institute Experience.Authors: Adnan K, Esfahani-Monfared Z, Sei S, Karimi S, Emami H, Khodadad KSource: Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):3817-22.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has long been a leading cause of cancer related death in both women and men worldwide. The focus of this study was to review clinicopathological features of Iranian patients diagnosed with lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological data of 1353 primary lung cancer patients diagnosed during 17 years (1997-2014) in the "National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease" (NRITLD), Tehran, Iran, were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 60 (mean: 58.95 years, range: 16- 99) and adenocarcinoma was the most prevalent pathology (45.2%). Male/female ratio was 3.22 and 57.2% of patients were smokers (men 70.3%, women 15%). The majority (85.3%) were referred in advanced stages (stage IIIB and IV). CONCLUSIONS: Although some of our findings are in concordance with other studies in lung cancer there are some discrepancies particularly in terms of smoking status and median age of Iranian patients. Further clinical and epidemiological studies are warranted to elucidate etiologic and factors other than smoking contributing to development of lung cancer, such as environmental exposures or genetic predisposition.PMID: 27644574Title: Analysis of the Prognostic Factors of Extensive Disease Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients in Tokushima University Hospital.Authors: Ogino H, Hanibuchi M, Kakiuchi S, Saijo A, Tezuka T, Toyoda Y, Tobiume M, Otsuka K, Sakaguchi S, Goto H, Arisawa K, Nishioka YSource: J Med Invest. 2016;63(3-4):286-93. doi: 10.2152/jmi.63.286.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presents aggressive clinical behavior, and its prognosis is still poor. Previously, performance status (PS), or the existence of brain, bone, or liver metastasis were reported to be unfavorable prognostic factors. Given the recent progress of treatment modalities such as radiotherapy techniques and bone modifying agents, the prognostic factors might be different from previous findings. Therefore, we analyzed the prognostic factors of extensive disease SCLC (ED-SCLC) in recent years. METHODS: ED-SCLC patients treated in Tokushima University Hospital between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed. Log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Totally, 79 patients were analyzed. In the univariate analysis, age, PS, interstitial pneumonia (IP), liver metastasis, pleural dissemination, neutrophil counts, hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia and several liver and biliary enzymes were identified as poor prognostic factors. In the multivariate analysis, age, PS, IP, and liver and biliary enzymes were identified. Moreover, the PS in patients with liver metastasis was significantly worsened. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we newly demonstrated that IP was a significant poor prognostic factor of ED-SCLC. Although liver metastasis was not extracted in multivariate analysis, it may have an impact on the prognosis of ED-SCLC. J. Med. Invest. 63: 286-293, August, 2016.PMID: 27644245Title: FABP5 correlates with poor prognosis and promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis in cervical cancer.Authors: Wang W, Chu HJ, Liang YC, Huang JM, Shang CL, Tan H, Liu D, Zhao YH, Liu TY, Yao SZSource: Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) was found in our previous study to be a potential biomarker for lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer. However, the roles of FABP5 in cervical cancer remain unclear. In the present study, FABP5 expression was found to be significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and high FABP5 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and tumor size. Moreover, FABP5 was an independent factor for poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Silencing of FABP5 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, FABP5 silencing significantly reduced tumor growth and lung metastases in a murine allograft model in vivo. In addition, FABP5 silencing decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicated that FABP5 plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of cervical cancer, and FABP5 may be a novel predictor for prognostic assessment of cervical cancer patients.PMID: 27644194Title: KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting miR-26a maturation in small cell lung cancer.Authors: Tong L, Luo Y, Wei T, Guo L, Wang H, Zhu W, Zhang JSource: Mol Cell Biochem. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that has a role in tumorigenesis of small cell lung cancer. The KHSRP protein level was shown to be significantly increased in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor tissues compared with normal lung tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, KHSRP protein levels were strongly associated with T stage in patients with SCLC. Using in vitro assays, we found that knockdown of the KHSRP gene inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis but had no effect on cell migration and invasion. We also showed that down-regulation of the KHSRP gene suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Further analyses indicated that KHSRP was involved in miR-26a maturation and inhibited the expression of PTEN in SCLC cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that KHSRP plays an important role in SCLC tumorigenesis and could be a potential novel therapeutic target for SCLC treatment.PMID: 27643927Title: Robotic Lung Cancer Surgery: A Missed Opportunity and a Faulty Conclusion.Authors: Rehmani S, Bhora F, Flores RSource: Ann Surg. 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: ?PMID: 27643908Title: Autoantibody-Associated Central Nervous System Neurologic Disorders.Authors: Linnoila J, Pittock SJSource: Semin Neurol. 2016 Aug;36(4):382-96. doi: 10.1055/s-0036-1585453. Epub 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Autoimmune neurology is a rapidly evolving new subspecialty driven by the discovery of novel neural- (neuronal- or glial-) specific autoantibodies and their target antigens. The neurologic manifestations affecting the central nervous system include encephalitis, dementia, epilepsy, and movement and sleep disorders. Laboratory testing is now available for most of these neural-specific autoantibodies, which serve as diagnostic markers, in some instances directing the physician toward specific cancer types (e.g., N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antibodies for teratoma, collapsin response mediator protein 5 for small-cell lung cancer) and assisting in therapeutic decision making. Antibodies targeting intracellular proteins serve as markers of cytotoxic effector T-cell-mediated injury, which is generally poorly responsive to immunotherapy. By contrast, antibodies targeting extracellular plasma membrane proteins may act as pathogenic effectors and often infer good responses to immunotherapy. Diagnosing these conditions and implementing treatment as early into the clinical course as possible ensures the best possible clinical outcomes. An adequate immunotherapy trial to assess maximum reversibility of symptoms, as assessed through objective functional measures, is crucial and can help to determine whether maintenance therapy is needed.PMID: 27643867Title: Toxoplasmosis encephalitis with immune-reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an allogeneic stem cell transplant patient: a case report.Authors: Gatti-Mays ME, Manion M, Bowen LN, Brown GT, Danner RL, Khan O, Nath A, Battiwalla M, Barrett AJ, Ito SSource: Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.230.Abstract: ?PMID: 27643705Title: Chemotherapy Drug Response to the L858R-induced Conformational Change of EGFR Activation Loop in Lung Cancer.Authors: Ding X, Liu X, Song X, Yao JSource: Mol Inform. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1002/minf.201600088.Abstract: Oncogenic L858R mutation of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confers constitutive activation to the kinase and is frequently observed in the pathological process of metastatic lung cancer. Selective inhibition of EGFRL858R mutant over wild-type EGFR (EGFRWT ) has been established as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. Here, we performed long-term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reconstruct the complete dynamics trajectory of L858R-induced conformational change in EGFR activation loop (A-loop). It was found that the mutation considerably destabilizes A-loop in Src-like inactive conformation and promotes the loop conversion to DFG-in active form. Electrostatic force is primarily responsible for the conversion and stabilization upon the mutation. Binding free energy analysis revealed that Gefitinib exhibits strong selectivity for mutant over wild-type kinases. The A-loop conformation, but not L858R mutation, directly determines inhibitor affinity; the mutation can indirectly influence inhibitor binding via regulation of A-loop conformation. Subsequently, chemical similarity searching was carried out with the structural sketch of Gefitinib against a large library of drug/lead-like compounds, from which two hits were identified to have high selectivity for EGFRL858R over EGFRW ; they can potently inhibit the kinase mutant with IC50 values at nanomolar level. The selectivity is primarily originated from hydrogen bond interactions of inhibitor ligands with mutant but not with wild type due to the A-loop conformational difference.PMID: 27643669Title: Endothelial glycocalyx layer shedding following lung resection.Authors: Arthur A, McCall PJ, Jolly L, Kinsella J, Kirk A, Shelley BGSource: Biomark Med. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: AIM: We investigated if the serum biomarkers of endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) disruption, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and syndecan-1 (SDC1) were elevated following lung resection surgery. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 16 patients undergoing lobectomy for primary lung cancer. HSPG and SDC1 were measured at five perioperative timepoints. Postoperative oxygenation was recorded. RESULTS: Post-hoc pair wise comparisons showed SDC1 concentration was significantly elevated on postoperative day 2, p < 0.001. There was no relationship found between HSPG or SDC1 levels and postoperative oxygenation. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study is the first to provide evidence of EGL disruption following lung resection surgery. We hypothesize that EGL disruption is involved in the pathogenesis of post-lung resection acute lung injury.

This process is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an attractive but traditionally intractable drug target. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that in preclinical models ACC is required to maintain the de novo fatty acid synthesis needed for growth and viability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We describe the ability of ND-646-an allosteric inhibitor of the ACC enzymes ACC1 and ACC2 that prevents ACC subunit dimerization-to suppress fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Chronic ND-646 treatment of xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC inhibited tumor growth. When administered as a single agent or in combination with the standard-of-care drug carboplatin, ND-646 markedly suppressed lung tumor growth in the Kras;Trp53-/- (also known as KRAS p53) and Kras;Stk11-/- (also known as KRAS Lkb1) mouse models of NSCLC. These findings demonstrate that ACC mediates a metabolic liability of NSCLC and that ACC inhibition by ND-646 is detrimental to NSCLC growth, supporting further examination of the use of ACC inhibitors in oncology.PMID: 27643558Title: Anticancer activity of silver nanoparticles from Panax ginseng fresh leaves in human cancer cells.Authors: Castro-Aceituno V, Ahn S, Simu SY, Singh P, Mathiyalagan R, Lee HA, Yang DCSource: Biomed Pharmacother. 2016 Sep 16;84:158-165. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.016.Abstract: The pharmaceutical role of silver nanoparticles has been increased over the last decades, especially those synthesized through herbal medicinal plants, due to their variety of pharmacological importance. Panax ginseng Meyer (P. ginseng) has been widely used as a therapeutic herbal medicine for a long time in cancer treatment. In this study, the cytotoxic and oxidative effect of a novel silver nanoparticles synthesized from P. ginseng fresh leaves (P.g AgNPs) were evaluated in different human cancer cell lines. In addition, the effect of P.g AgNPs on cell migration, apoptosis and the determination of the mechanism involve was determinate by the use of A549 lung cancer cell line. It was found that P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited cell viability and induced oxidative stress in A549, MCF7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Likewise, P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced migration, as well as decreased the mRNA levels and phosphorylation of EGF receptors in A549 cells. Moreover, P.g AgNPs modified the morphology of the cell nucleus and increase apoptosis percentage; this effect was linked to the stimulation of p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Taken together, our results showed that P.g AgNPs exhibited anti-cancer activity in A549 and the regulation of EGFR/p38 MAPK/p53 pathway might be the possible mechanism of its anti-activity. Further experiments are suggested to determinate the mechanism by which P.g AgNPs induce cytotoxicity and ROS generation in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells.PMID: 27643554Title: miR-135b reverses chemoresistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells by downregulation of FZD1.Authors: Su W, Mo Y, Wu F, Guo K, Li J, Luo Y, Ye H, Guo H, Li D, Yang ZSource: Biomed Pharmacother. 2016 Sep 16;84:123-129. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.027.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) chemoresistance usually limits the clinical efficacy of chemotherapeutic approaches. However, few reports have revealed the regulation of miR-135b and Frizzled-1 (FZD1) involved in NSCLC chemoresistance. METHODS: To identify the mechanism of miR-135b and FZD1 in NSCLC chemoresistance and to observe their biological functions, we detected the expression levels of miR-135b and FZD1 by conducting quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and modified the expressions of miR-135b and FZD1 by transiently transfecting cells with miR-135b mimics or FZD1-siRNA. The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of FZD1 combined with miR-135b was verified through dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Compared with that in A549 parental cell lines, the miR-135b expression in drug-resistant lung cancer cell lines (A549/DDP) was decreased and their FZD1 expression was increased. The increased miR-135b expression and silenced FZD1 expression enhanced the sensitivity of resistant cells to cisplatin treatment. The high expression of miR-135b in A549/DDP cells remarkably decreased the mRNA levels of FZD1. FZD1 was further identified as the functional downstream target of miR-135b by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of FZD1. CONCLUSION: The amplification of miR-135b suppressed NSCLC chemoresistance by directly mediating the FZD1 downregulation.PMID: 27642589Title: Circular RNA-ITCH Suppresses Lung Cancer Proliferation via Inhibiting the Wnt/beta-Catenin Pathway.Authors: Wan L, Zhang L, Fan K, Cheng ZX, Sun QC, Wang JJSource: Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:1579490. doi: 10.1155/2016/1579490. Epub 2016 Aug 24.Abstract: As a special form of noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) played important roles in regulating cancer progression mainly by functioning as miRNA sponge. While the function of circular RNA-ITCH (cir-ITCH) in lung cancer is still less reported, in this study, we firstly detected the expression of cir-ITCH in tumor tissues and paired adjacent noncancer tissues of 78 patients with lung cancer using a TaqMan-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the expression of cir-ITCH was significantly decreased in lung cancer tissues. In cellular studies, cir-ITCH was also enhanced in different lung cancer cell lines, A549 and NIC-H460. Ectopic expression of cir-ITCH markedly elevated its parental cancer-suppressive gene, ITCH, expression and inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells. Molecular analysis further revealed that cir-ITCH acted as sponge of oncogenic miR-7 and miR-214 to enhance ITCH expression and thus suppressed the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Altogether, our results suggested that cir-ITCH may play an inhibitory role in lung cancer progression by enhancing its parental gene, ITCH, expression.PMID: 27642531Title: Cardiac Relapse of Acute Myeloid Leukemia after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.Authors: Facenda-Lorenzo M, Sanchez-Quintana A, Quijada-Fumero A, Laynez-Carnicero A, Brena-Atienza J, Poncela-Mireles FJ, Llanos-Gomez JM, Cabello-Rodriguez AI, Ramos-Lopez MSource: Case Rep Oncol Med. 2016;2016:5091021. doi: 10.1155/2016/5091021. Epub 2016 Aug 23.Abstract: Secondary or metastatic cardiac tumors are much more common than primary benign or malignant cardiac tumors. Any tumor can cause myocardial or pericardial metastasis, although isolated or combined tumor invasion of the pericardium is more common. Types of neoplasia with the highest rates of cardiac or pericardial involvement are melanoma, lung cancer, and breast and mediastinal carcinomas. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Initial treatment involves chemotherapy followed by consolidation treatment to reduce the risk of relapse. In high-risk patients, the treatment of choice for consolidation is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Relapse of AML is the most common cause of HSCT failure. Extramedullary relapse is rare. The organs most frequently affected, called "sanctuaries," are the testes, ovaries, and central nervous system. We present a case with extramedullary relapse in the form of a solid cardiac mass.PMID: 27642498Title: The Janus-Faced Role of Antioxidants in Cancer Cachexia: New Insights on the Established Concepts.Authors: Assi M, Rebillard ASource: Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2016;2016:9579868. doi: 10.1155/2016/9579868. Epub 2016 Aug 24.Abstract: Chronic inflammation and excessive loss of skeletal muscle usually occur during cancer cachexia, leading to functional impairment and delaying the cure of cancer. The release of cytokines by tumor promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn regulate catabolic pathways involved in muscle atrophy. ROS also exert a dual role within tumor itself, as they can either promote proliferation and vascularization or induce senescence and apoptosis. Accordingly, previous studies that used antioxidants to modulate these ROS-dependent mechanisms, in cancer and cancer cachexia, have obtained contradictory results, hence the need to gather the main findings of these studies and draw global conclusions in order to stimulate more oriented research in this field. Based on the literature reviewed in this paper, it appears that antioxidant supplementation is (1) beneficial in cancer cachectic patients with antioxidant deficiencies, (2) most likely harmful in cancer patients with adequate antioxidant status (i.e., lung, gastrointestinal, head and neck, and esophageal), and (3) not recommended when undergoing radiotherapy. At the moment, measuring the blood levels of antioxidants may help to identify patients with systemic deficiencies. This approach is simple to realize but could not be a gold standard method for cachexia, as it does not necessarily reflect the redox state in other organs, like muscle.PMID: 27642473Title: The role of cervical mediastinoscopy in Nigerian thoracic surgical practice.Authors: Falase B, Ogadinma M, Majekodunmi A, Nimasahun B, Adeyeye OSource: Pan Afr Med J. 2016 Jun 10;24:135. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2016.24.135.7668. eCollection 2016.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cervical mediastinoscopy is the gold standard for obtaining histological diagnosis of mediastinal pathology. It has been used for the staging of lung cancer as well as to determine the cause of Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy. There is very limited evidence in the literature of its use in Nigeria to assess mediastinal pathology. The aim of this study was to describe our institutional experience with cervical mediastinoscopy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 40 patients that underwent cervical mediastinoscopy in our institution between March 2007 and February 2013. RESULTS: The indication for Cervical Mediastinoscopy was Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy in 24 patients (60%) and lung cancer staging in 16 patient (40%). The mean age of the patients was 52.7 + 15.1 years. There were 21 females (52.5%) and 19 males (47.5%). The most commonly biopsied lymph nodes were level 4 in 35 patients (87.5%) and level 7 in 21 patients (52.5%). Malignant diagnosis was made in 16 (66.7%) patients with Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy and in 13 (81.3%) patients staged for lung cancer. Hospital stay was less than 24 hours in all patients and there were no complications. CONCLUSION: Cervical Mediastinoscopy is available in Nigeria and has been performed in our institution with high diagnostic yield and no complications. Its increased use, along with the development of other mediastinal biopsy techniques is advocated to increase tissue biopsy of mediastinal pathology, especially for lung cancer and isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy.PMID: 27642472Title: Cutaneous metastasis to the face from lung adenocarcinoma.Authors: Brahmi SA, Seddik YSource: Pan Afr Med J. 2016 Jun 10;24:134. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2016.24.134.9504. eCollection 2016.Abstract: ?PMID: 27642457Title: [Fatal acute interstitial lung disease associated with docetaxel administration: about a case and review of the literature].Authors: Brahmi SA, Youssef S, Ziani FZ, Afqir SSource: Pan Afr Med J. 2016 Jun 7;24:119. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2016.24.119.8902. eCollection 2016.Abstract: Docetaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent belonging to the taxane family. This drug is widely used to treat cancers. Interstitial lung disease is a rare but serious toxicity due to the high mortality risk. We report a case of a patient with breast cancer who had fatal acute interstitial lung disease after auxiliary chemotherapy with docetaxel. The clinician should be aware of this risk and should consider it in differential diagnosis in patients with respiratory symptoms treated with docetaxel.PMID: 27642363Title: Cancer Feature Selection and Classification Using a Binary Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and Support Vector Machine.Authors: Xi M, Sun J, Liu L, Fan F, Wu XSource: Comput Math Methods Med. 2016;2016:3572705. doi: 10.1155/2016/3572705. Epub 2016 Aug 24.Abstract: This paper focuses on the feature gene selection for cancer classification, which employs an optimization algorithm to select a subset of the genes. We propose a binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (BQPSO) for cancer feature gene selection, coupling support vector machine (SVM) for cancer classification. First, the proposed BQPSO algorithm is described, which is a discretized version of original QPSO for binary 0-1 optimization problems. Then, we present the principle and procedure for cancer feature gene selection and cancer classification based on BQPSO and SVM with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). Finally, the BQPSO coupling SVM (BQPSO/SVM), binary PSO coupling SVM (BPSO/SVM), and genetic algorithm coupling SVM (GA/SVM) are tested for feature gene selection and cancer classification on five microarray data sets, namely, Leukemia, Prostate, Colon, Lung, and Lymphoma. The experimental results show that BQPSO/SVM has significant advantages in accuracy, robustness, and the number of feature genes selected compared with the other two algorithms.PMID: 27642319Title: Celecoxib Treatment Alters p53 and MDM2 Expression via COX-2 Crosstalk in A549 Cells.Authors: Gharghabi M, Rezaei F, Mir Mohammadrezaei F, Ghahremani MHSource: Iran J Pharm Res. 2016 Spring;15(2):483-9.Abstract: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the lung cancer. It is known that COX-2 negatively regulates the activity of a number of tumor suppressors, including p53. Consequently, inhibition of COX-2 signaling is anticipated to be a promising approach to stabilize p53 functionality. In this regard, we investigated the effect of COX-2 signaling blockade on p53 and COX-2expression in A549 cells. Cell viability was assessed using MTT and protein expression was measured using Western Blot assay. Results revealed that Celecoxib dose-dependently induced growth inhibition within 24 h. However, prolonged exposure to the drug up to 48 h led to increase cell viability compared to the corresponding control. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Celecoxib could augment p53 expression within 24 h, independently of COX-2 inhibition. In contrast, Celecoxib treatment not only returned p53 to the control level, but also strikingly induced COX-2 expression within 48 h. Of further relevance, Celecoxib exposure could significantly result in MDM2 elevation at 48 h. These findings represent p53 as a molecular target being interconnected with COX-2 signaling axis upon Celecoxib treatment. Moreover, our data point toward the possibility that Celecoxib treatment may not be a proper therapeutic strategy in lung cancer cells owing to its potential role in the activation of oncogenes, including COX-2 and MDM2 which seemingly confers a chemoresistance circumstance to the cell. Consequently, these results underscore intensive preclinical assessment prior to applying COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of lung tumors.PMID: 27642134Title: Concomitant Opioid and Laxative Use in Older Adults in Hospice Care in the United States: 2007.Authors: Lau DT, Dwyer LL, Shega JWSource: J Am Geriatr Soc. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1111/jgs.14462.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To examine laxative use by individuals in hospice who were taking opioids during the last week of life. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional. SETTING: 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals in hospice aged 65 and older who were taking opioids during the last week of life (N = 2,825). MEASUREMENTS: Hospice staff were asked the names of all medications and drugs that participants were taking 7 days before and on the day of death while in hospice, including any standing, routine, or as-needed medications." Medications "used" included medications taken and as-needed medications provided in case a symptom developed. Opioids included all opioid-combination drugs. Laxatives included fibers, lubricants, stimulants, and suppositories. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of participants had cancer as the primary hospice diagnosis, 13% heart disease, 12% debility, 11% dementia, 8% lung disease, and 15% other. Overall, 52% of opioid users used a laxative in the last week of life; the proportions of opioid and laxative users did not differ according to diagnosis. Racial minorities taking opioids had lower odds than white participants (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33-0.99) of using laxatives. Participants taking opioids enrolled in hospice for 7 days or less had lower odds of using laxatives than those enrolled for more than 7 days (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.37-0.95), as did those in hospice inpatient, hospital, or other settings (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.43-0.93) than those in long-term care settings. Participants using five or fewer medications had lower odds of using laxatives than those using six to 10 (OR = 6.01, 95% CI = 3.88-9.32) or 11 to 25 medications (OR = 13.80, 95% CI = 8.74-21.80). CONCLUSION: In 2007, slightly more than half of older adults in hospice who were taking opioids used laxatives during the last week of life. Recent quality indicators from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend laxative treatment when opioid therapy is initiated to prevent opioid-induced constipation and are intended to improve laxative use in individuals in hospice treated with opioids.PMID: 27642065Title: Primary Double-Strike Therapy for Cancers to Overcome EGFR Kinase Inhibitor Resistance: Proposal from the Bench.Authors: Suda K, Bunn PA Jr, Rivard CJ, Mitsudomi T, Hirsch FRSource: J Thorac Oncol. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S1556-0864(16)30948-0. doi: 10.1016/j.jtho.2016.09.003.Abstract: Diverse molecular mechanisms have been reported that confer acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung cancers with sensitive EGFR mutations. However, it is not realistic to analyze for all these mechanisms at the time of resistance in clinical practice, and to establish adequate treatment targeting these numerous resistance mechanisms. Therefore, we consider that we should move our research focus from the exploration of "established" diverse resistance mechanisms to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to remain alive at the early phase of the treatment. Here in this review, we summarize up-to-date molecular mechanisms that maintain residual tumor cells against EGFR-TKI monotherapy in lung cancers with EGFR mutations. We classified these mechanisms into three categories. First is a pre-existing minor subpopulation with resistance mechanism such as a pre-treatment T790M mutation that can be detected by highly sensitivity methods. Second is the reversible drug tolerant state which is often observed in cell line models and which accounts for the lack of complete response and continued survival of cells exposed to EGFR-TKIs in patients. And the last is the role of the microenvironment, including survival signaling from fibroblasts or dying cancer cells and role of poor vascularization. Primary double-strike cancer therapy, or even initial multiple-strike therapy, to cancer cells that co-target EGFR and survival mechanism(s) simultaneously would be a promising strategy to improve patients outcomes with EGFR mutations.PMID: 27642006Title: Full-length model of the human galectin-4 and insights into dynamics of inter-domain communication.Authors: Rustiguel JK, Soares RO, Meisburger SP, Davis KM, Malzbender KL, Ando N, Dias-Baruffi M, Nonato MCSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 19;6:33633. doi: 10.1038/srep33633.Abstract: Galectins are proteins involved in diverse cellular contexts due to their capacity to decipher and respond to the information encoded by beta-galactoside sugars. In particular, human galectin-4, normally expressed in the healthy gastrointestinal tract, displays differential expression in cancerous tissues and is considered a potential drug target for liver and lung cancer. Galectin-4 is a tandem-repeat galectin characterized by two carbohydrate recognition domains connected by a linker-peptide. Despite their relevance to cell function and pathogenesis, structural characterization of full-length tandem-repeat galectins has remained elusive. Here, we investigate galectin-4 using X-ray crystallography, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, molecular modelling, molecular dynamics simulations, and differential scanning fluorimetry assays and describe for the first time a structural model for human galectin-4. Our results provide insight into the structural role of the linker-peptide and shed light on the dynamic characteristics of the mechanism of carbohydrate recognition among tandem-repeat galectins.PMID: 27641932Title: Comparison of the 7(th) and proposed 8(th) editions of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system for non-small cell lung cancer undergoing radical surgery.Authors: Jin Y, Chen M, Yu XSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 19;6:33587. doi: 10.1038/srep33587.Abstract: The present study aims to compare the 7(th) and the proposed 8(th) edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system for NSCLC in a cohort of patients from a single institution. A total of 408 patients with NSCLC who underwent radical surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Survivals were analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and C-index were applied to compare the two prognostic systems with different numbers of stages. The 7(th) AJCC T categories, the proposed 8(th) AJCC T categories, N categories, visceral pleural invasion, and vessel invasion were found to have statistically significant associations with disease-free survival (DFS) on univariate analysis. In the 7(th) edition staging system as well as in the proposed 8(th) edition, T categories, N categories, and pleural invasion were independent factors for DFS on multivariate analysis. The AIC value was smaller for the 8(th) edition compared to the 7(th) edition staging system. The C-index value was larger for the 8(th) edition compared to the 7(th) edition staging system. Based on the data from our single center, the proposed 8(th) AJCC T classification seems to be superior to the 7(th) AJCC T classification in terms of DFS for patients with NSCLC underwent radical surgery.PMID: 27641783Title: Quantification of coronary artery motion and internal risk volume from ECG gated radiotherapy planning scans.Authors: Kataria T, Bisht SS, Gupta D, Abhishek A, Basu T, Narang K, Goyal S, Shukla P, Bansal M, Grewal H, Ahlawat K, Banarjee S, Tayal MSource: Radiother Oncol. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S0167-8140(16)31247-6. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2016.08.006.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy for carcinoma of breast and thoracic structures involves inadvertent radiation to heart and coronary arteries (CA). Coronary artery stenosis in high radiation dose segments has been documented. Cardiac and respiratory motion induced displacement of CA and internal risk volume (IRV) margin remains inadequately quantified. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty cases of carcinoma breast, lung and lung metastasis were enrolled in this study. ECG gated intravenous contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scans were performed in inspiratory breath hold (IBH) and expiratory breath hold (EBH). The images were segregated into inspiratory systole (IS), inspiratory diastole (ID), expiratory systole (ES) and expiratory diastole (ED) sets. Left anterior descending (LAD), limited segment of LAD close to chest wall (short LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), Left circumflex artery (LCX) and left ventricle (LV) were delineated in all four sets. Mean displacements in systole versus diastole and inspiration versus expiration were calculated in three co-ordinates [anterio-posterior (Z), left-right (X) and cranio-caudal (Y)]. RESULTS: Mean of displacement (mm) between systole and diastole (IS versus ID; and ES versus ED) in X, Y, Z co-ordinates were: LAD 3.0(+/-1.6), 2.8(+/-1.5), 3.6(+/-2.0); Short-LAD 3.0(+/-1.1), 0.8(+/-0.4), 2.4(+/-0.6); LV 2.4(+/-1.6), 1.7(+/-1), 5.0(+/-1.5); LCX 4.9(+/-1.6), 2.9(+/-1.3), 5.1(+/-1.9); RCA 6.6(+/-2.2), 3.6(+/-2.1), 5.9(+/-2.2). Mean displacement between inspiration and expiration (IS versus ES; and ID versus ED) in X, Y, Z axes were: LAD 3.3(+/-1.5), 8.0(+/-3.4), 3.8(+/-1.8); Short-LAD 2.7(+/-1), 12.2(+/-4.4), 3.3(+/-1.5); LV 2.9(+/-1.4), 9.8(+/-3.3), 4.7(+/-1.9); LCX 2.9(+/-.8), 9.7(+/-3.2), 6.2(+/-2.5); RCA 2.6(+/-1.3), 7.6(+/-2.5), 3.8(+/-1.7). CONCLUSION: Radial (RM), cranio-caudal margin (CC) of 7mm, 4mm in breath-hold radiotherapy whereas RM, CC of 7mm, 13mm respectively in free breath radiotherapy will cover the range of motions of CA, LV and can be recommended as IRV for these structures.PMID: 27641744Title: Circulating tumor DNA detection in lung cancer patients before and after surgery.Authors: Guo N, Lou F, Ma Y, Li J, Yang B, Chen W, Ye H, Zhang JB, Zhao MY, Wu WJ, Shi R, Jones L, Chen KS, Huang XF, Chen SY, Liu YSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 19;6:33519. doi: 10.1038/srep33519.Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood is a "liquid biopsy" that contains representative tumor information including gene mutations. Additionally, repeated ctDNA samples can be easily obtained to monitor response to treatment and disease progression, which may be especially valuable to lung cancer patients with tumors that cannot be easily biopsied or removed. To investigate the changes in ctDNA after surgical tumor resection, tumor and blood samples obtained before and after surgery were collected prospectively from 41 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Somatic driver mutations in tumor DNA (tDNA) and pre- and post-op plasma ctDNA sample pairs were identified by targeted sequencing in several genes including EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 with an overall study concordance of 78.1% and sensitivity and specificity of 69.2% and 93.3%, respectively. Importantly, the frequency of 91.7% of ctDNA mutations decreased after surgery and these changes were observed as little as 2 days post-op. Moreover, the presence of ctDNA had a higher positive predictive value than that of six tumor biomarkers in current clinical use. This study demonstrates the use of targeted sequencing to reliably identify ctDNA changes in response to treatment, indicating a potential utility of this approach in the clinical management of NSCLC.PMID: 27641735Title: MicroRNA-1304 suppresses human non-small cell lung cancer cell growth in vitro by targeting heme oxygenase-1.Authors: Li CG, Pu MF, Li CZ, Gao M, Liu MX, Yu CZ, Yan H, Peng C, Zhao Y, Li Y, Ma ZL, Qi XM, Wang YZ, Miao LL, Ren JSource: Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/aps.2016.92.Abstract: AIM: Previous studies have shown that microRNA-1304 (miR-1304) is dysregulated in certain types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and might be involved in tumor survival and/or growth. In this study we investigated the direct target of miR-1304 and its function in NSCLC in vitro. METHODS: Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and NCI-H1975) were studied. The cell proliferation and survival were investigated via cell counting, MTT and colony-formation assays. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined using annexin V-PE/7-AAD and PI staining assays, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify post-transcriptional regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by miR-1304. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to deplete endogenous miR-1304. RESULTS: Overexpression of MiR-1304 significantly decreased the number and viability of NSCLC cells and colony formation, and induced cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. HO-1 was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-1304 in NSCLC cells. Restoration of HO-1 expression by hemin (20 mumol/L) abolished the inhibition of miR-1304 on cell growth and rescued miR-1304-induced apoptosis in A549 cells. Suppression of endogenous miR-1304 with anti-1304 significantly increased HO-1 expression and promoted cell growth and survival in A549 cells. In 17 human NSCLC tissue samples, miR-1304 expression was significantly decreased, while HO-1 expression was significantly increased as compared to normal lung tissues. CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-1304 is a tumor suppressor and HO-1 is its direct target in NSCLC. The results suggest the potential for miR-1304 as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.PMID: 27641688Title: TIF-IA: An oncogenic target of pre-ribosomal RNA synthesis.Authors: Jin R, Zhou WSource: Biochim Biophys Acta. 2016 Sep 16. pii: S0304-419X(16)30064-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2016.09.003.Abstract: Cancer cells devote the majority of their energy consumption to ribosome biogenesis, and pre-ribosomal RNA transcription accounts for 30-50% of all transcriptional activity. This aberrantly elevated biological activity is an attractive target for cancer therapeutic intervention if approaches can be developed to circumvent the development of side effects in normal cells. TIF-IA is a transcription factor that connects RNA polymerase I with the UBF/SL-1 complex to initiate the transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA. Its function is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, and its activity is promoted by the phosphorylation of various oncogenic kinases in cancer cells. The depletion of TIF-IA induces cell death in lung cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts but not in several other normal tissue types evaluated in knock-out studies. Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of TIF-IA under UTP down-regulated conditions requires the activity of LKB1 kinase, and LKB1-inactivated cancer cells are susceptible to cell death under such stress conditions. Therefore, TIF-IA may be a unique target to suppress ribosome biogenesis without significantly impacting the survival of normal tissues.PMID: 27641640Title: Urinary excretion of the beta-adrenergic feed additives ractopamine and zilpaterol in breast and lung cancer patients.Authors: Cheng TD, Shelver WL, Hong CC, McCann SE, Davis W, Zhang Y, Ambrosone CB, Smith DJSource: J Agric Food Chem. 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: beta2-adrenergic agonists (beta-agonists) have been legally used in the U.S. for almost two decades to increase lean muscle mass in meat animals. Despite a cardiotoxic effect after high-dose exposure, there has been limited research on human beta-agonist exposures related to meat consumption. We quantified urinary concentrations of ractopamine and zilpaterol, two FDA-approved beta-agonist feed additives, and examined the extent to which the concentrations were associated with estimated usual meat intake levels. Overnight urine samples from 324 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and spot urine samples from 46 lung cancer patients at the time of diagnosis, prior to treatment, were collected during 2006-2010 and 2014-2015, respectively. Urinary ractopamine and zilpaterol concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS. Ractopamine and zilpaterol, respectively, were detected in 8.1% and 3.0% of the urine samples collected (n=370). Only 1.1% (n=4) of the urine samples had zilpaterol concentrations above the limit of quantification, with the mean value of 0.07 ng/mL in urine. The presence of detectable ractopamine and zilpaterol levels were not associated with meat consumption estimated from a food frequency questionnaire, including total meat (P=0.13 and 0.74, respectively), total red meat (P=0.72 and 0.74), unprocessed red meat (P=0.74 and 0.73), processed red meat (0.72 and 0.15), and poultry intake (P=0.67 for ractopamine). Our data suggest that the amount of meat-related exposure of beta-agonists was low.PMID: 27641492Title: Place of death in children and young people with cancer and implications for end of life care: a population-based study in England, 1993-2014.Authors: Gao W, Verne J, Peacock J, Stiller C, Wells C, Greenough A, Higginson IJSource: BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 19;16(1):727. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2695-1.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Efforts to improve end of life care (EoLC) have made tangible impacts on care in adults, including enabling more people to die at their preferred place of death (PoD), usually home or hospices. Little is known how the PoD in children and young people (CYP, </=24 years) has changed over time, especially in the context of a series of national initiatives for EoLC improvement since the late 1990s. To inform evidence-based policy-making and service development, we evaluated the national trends of PoD and the associated factors in CYP who died with cancer. METHODS: Population-based observational study in the National Health Service (NHS) England, 1993-2014. All non-accidental CYP deaths with cancer (N = 12,774) were extracted from the death registration database of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). RESULTS: Hospital deaths reduced from >50 to 45 %, hospice deaths were rare but more than doubled from 6 % in 1993-2000 to 13 % in 2005-2014, and home deaths fluctuated at around 40 %. Those aged 0-19 years were more likely to die at home than young adults (adjusted proportion ratio (PRs): 1.23-1.62); haematological cancer patients or those with 2+ comorbid conditions had higher chances of hospital death (PRs for home: 0.18-0.75, hospice: 0.04-0.37); deprivation was associated with a reduced chance of home death (PRs: 0.76-0.84). The residential region affected hospice but not home deaths. The variations of PoD by cause of death, comorbid conditions and deprivation slightly decreased with time. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals and home were the main EoLC settings for CYP with cancer. Home death rates barely changed in the past two decades; deaths in hospitals remained the most common but slightly shifted towards hospices. CYP with haematological malignancy or with comorbid conditions had persistently high hospital deaths; these cases had an even lower chance of deaths in hospices (50 %) than at home. There were deprivation- and area-related inequalities in PoD which may need service- and/or policy-level intervention. The findings highlight a need for CYP specific initiatives to enhance EoLC support and capacities both at home and in hospices.PMID: 27641484Title: Haploidentical related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for DOCK8 deficiency.Authors: Freeman AF, Shah NN, Parta M, Su HC, Brofferio A, Gradus-Pizlo I, Butty S, Hughes TE, Kleiner DE, Avila D, Heller T, Kong HH, Holland SM, Hickstein DDSource: J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S2213-2198(16)30311-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jaip.2016.06.028.Abstract: ?PMID: 27641463Title: [High-dose chemotherapy as a strategy to overcome drug resistance in solid tumors].Authors: Selle F, Gligorov J, Soares DG, Lotz JPSource: Bull Cancer. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S0007-4551(16)30189-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bulcan.2016.08.002.Abstract: The concept of high-doses chemotherapy was developed in the 1980s based on in vitro scientific observations. Exposure of tumor cells to increasing concentrations of alkylating agents resulted in increased cell death in a strong dose-response manner. Moreover, the acquired resistance of tumor cells could be overcome by dose intensification. In clinic, dose intensification of alkylating agents resulted in increased therapeutic responses, however associated with significant hematological toxicity. Following the development of autologous stem cells transplantation harvesting from peripheral blood, the high-doses of chemotherapy, initially associated with marked toxic effects, could be more easily tolerated. As a result, the approach was evaluated in different types of solid tumors, including breast, ovarian and germ cell tumors, small cell lung carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas and Ewing sarcoma. To date, high-doses chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cells support is only used as a salvage therapy to treat poor prognosis germ cell tumors patients with chemo-sensitive disease. Regarding breast and ovarian cancer, high-doses chemotherapy should be considered only in the context of clinical trials. However, intensive therapy as an approach to overcome resistance to standard treatments is still relevant. Numerous efforts are still ongoing to identify novel therapeutic combinations and active treatments to improve patients' responses.PMID: 27641462Title: [Osimertinib (Tagrisso(R)): Activity, indication and modality of use in non-small cell lung cancer].Authors: Giroux Leprieur E, Cortot AB, Cadranel J, Wislez MSource: Bull Cancer. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S0007-4551(16)30191-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bulcan.2016.06.007.Abstract: The acquisition of a resistance EGFR mutation in exon 20 (T790M) occurs in half of the cases of secondary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), given in first-line treatment in advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso(R)) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR TKI, active in case of T790M mutation. A large phase I trial showed the efficacy of osimertinib after failure of first-generation EGFR TKI (erlotinib, gefitinib), with response rate at 51% and up to 61% in case of T790M mutation. Progression-free survival was 9.6 months in case of T790M. Toxicity profile was acceptable, with mainly digestive (diarrhea) and skin (rash) side effects. Preliminary data from a phase II trial confirmed these efficacy and safety data. Screening of T790M mutation at the time of progression with TKI can be performed in circulating tumor DNA in plasma, with good diagnostic performances.PMID: 27641337Title: INO80 is required for oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Zhang S, Zhou B, Wang L, Li P, Bennett BD, Snyder R, Garantziotis S, Fargo DC, Cox AD, Chen L, Hu GSource: Oncogene. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.311.Abstract: Epigenetic regulators are attractive targets for the development of new cancer therapies. Among them, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes control the chromatin architecture and have important roles in gene regulation. They are often found to be mutated and de-regulated in cancers, but how they influence the cancer gene expression program during cancer initiation and progression is not fully understood. Here we show that the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is required for oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ino80, the SWI/SNF ATPase in the complex, is highly expressed in NSCLC cells compared with normal lung epithelia cells. Further, its expression, as well as that of another subunit Ino80B, negatively correlates with disease prognosis in lung cancer patients. Functionally, INO80 silencing inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor formation in mouse xenografts. It occupies enhancer regions near lung cancer-associated genes, and its occupancy correlates with increased genome accessibility and enhanced expression of downstream genes. Together, our study defines a critical role of INO80 in promoting oncogenic transcription and NSCLC tumorigenesis, and reveals a potential treatment strategy for inhibiting the cancer transcription network by targeting the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.311.PMID: 27641336Title: The microRNA-182-PDK4 axis regulates lung tumorigenesis by modulating pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipogenesis.Authors: Li G, Li M, Hu J, Lei R, Xiong H, Ji H, Yin H, Wei Q, Hu GSource: Oncogene. 2016 Sep 19. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.265.Abstract: Reprogrammed metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The dysregulation of glycolysis in cancer has been heavily studied. However, it remains largely unclear how other metabolic processes are regulated in cancer cells. Here we show that microRNA-182 (miR-182) suppresses pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) and promotes lung tumorigenesis. miR-182 is dysregulated and inversely correlated with PDK4 in human lung adenocarcinomas. The miR-182-PDK4 axis regulates lung cancer cell growth by modulating the activity of PDH, the gatekeeping enzyme of pyruvate flux into acetyl-CoA, and subsequently de novo lipogenesis of cancer cells. Suppression of lipogenesis by silencing ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) or by chemical inhibitors diminishes the effects of miR-182-PDK4 in tumor growth. Alteration of de novo lipogenesis also affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the downstream JNK signaling pathway. Hence, our work suggests that the miR-182-PDK4 axis is a crucial regulator of cancer cell metabolism and a potential target for antitumor therapy.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.265.PMID: 27640882Title: Mutation analysis of circulating plasma DNA to determine response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy of lung adenocarcinoma patients.Authors: Riediger AL, Dietz S, Schirmer U, Meister M, Heinzmann-Groth I, Schneider M, Muley T, Thomas M, Sultmann HSource: Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 19;6:33505. doi: 10.1038/srep33505.Abstract: Long-lasting success in lung cancer therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is rare since the tumors develop resistance due to the occurrence of molecularly altered subclones. The aim of this study was to monitor tumors over time based on the quantity of mutant plasma DNA and to identify early indications for therapy response and tumor progression. Serial plasma samples from lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with TKIs were used to quantify EGFR and KRAS mutations in circulating DNA by digital PCR. Mutant DNA levels were compared with the courses of responses to treatment with TKIs, conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or combinations thereof. Variations in plasma DNA mutation levels over time were found in 15 patients. We categorize three major courses: First, signs of therapy response are associated with a fast clearing of plasma DNA mutations within a few days. Second, periods of stable disease are accompanied by either absence of mutations or fluctuation at low levels. Finally, dramatic increase of mutational load is followed by rapid tumor progression and poor patient survival. In summary, the serial assessment of EGFR mutations in the plasma of NSCLC patients allows conclusions about controlled disease and tumor progression earlier than currently available methods.PMID: 27640551Title: Association of polymorphisms in Dickopff (DKK) gene towards modulating risk for lung cancer in north Indians.Authors: Bahl C, Singh N, Behera D, Sharma SSource: Future Oncol. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: AIM: To investigate the association between the genetic variants of DKK4 (rs2073664), DKK3 (rs2291599, rs3206824 and rs7391689) and DKK2 (rs447372, rs419558 and rs17037102) and lung cancer predisposition in north Indians. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 600 subjects were genotyped using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Association analysis was carried out using logistic regression approach. RESULTS: DKK3 rs7396187 showed a protective effect (p = 0.01). Subjects with heterozygous genotype of DKK2 rs17037102 and rs419558 showed an increased risk. The variant genotype of the genotypic combination, DKK3 rs3206824 and DKK2 rs419558 showed a twofold increased risk (p = 0.008). Lung cancer risk increased four-times in subjects with variant genotype of all the three DKK2 variants. CONCLUSION: DKK2 is certainly playing a crucial role in modulating cancer susceptibility.PMID: 27640524Title: On-line miniaturized asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for metalloprotein analysis of plasma from patients with lung cancer.Authors: Kim JY, Lim HB, Moon MHSource: Anal Chem. 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: Metalloproteins (metal-binding proteins) refer to proteins containing metal ion cofactors. The importance of these proteins has increased owing to their involvement in many biological processes. Here, we introduce an analytical platform based on on-line coupling of miniaturized asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (mAF4) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for size separation of proteins followed by the detection of metals associated with plasma metallo-proteins. Not only did the mild separation of mAF4 carried out in a biological buffer solution minimize disruption of the metal-complex structure but free metal ions and salts from complicated biological samples were also removed during separa-tion by crossflow. The relative quantities of metalloproteins detected by mAF4-ICP-MS between plasma samples from pa-tients with lung cancer and healthy controls were compared by determining the peak areas of detected elements and reten-tion times; among these, seven (55Mn, 60Ni, 63Cu, 66Zn, 90Zr, 127I, and 137Ba) out of 16 elements showed substantial changes in patients with lung cancer. For the quantitative comparison of metalloproteins, protein fractions during mAF4 were collected and analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using isotope-coded carbamidomethylation. Quantitative analysis showed that some metalloproteins associated with 55Mn, 60Ni, 63Cu, and 66Zn exhibited changes similar to those in patients. These findings demonstrated the potential of mAF4-ICP-MS as a powerful high-speed screening method for targeted metalloproteins related to diseases.PMID: 27640391Title: Synthesis of 6-N-R-Tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5(6H)-ones and Their Anticancer Activity.Authors: Antypenko O, Kovalenko S, Rasulev B, Leszczynski JSource: Acta Chim Slov. 2016;63(3):638-45.Abstract: Chemical compounds with tetrazole ring are very interesting systems that can be valuable in pharmaceutical and clinical applications, especially as anticancer agents. In this work, novel 6-N-R-tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5(6H)-ones were synthesized. A large set of IR, LC-, EI-MS, 1H, 13C NMR and elemental analysis data were collected and evaluated for their structures and purity. Details of synthesis, namely the N-alkylation, are discussed, including reactions with secondary and tertiary amides. Four new synthesized compounds (2.7, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3) were tested in vitro for anticancer activity at 10 muM against 60 cell lines of nine different cancer types: leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, CNS, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers. Further synthesis of substances within the series of substituted tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline systems will be attempted to develop improved compounds with better anticancer activity.PMID: 27640312Title: Disulfide-crosslinked nanomicelles confer cancer-specific drug delivery and improve efficacy of paclitaxel in bladder cancer.Authors: Pan A, Zhang H, Li Y, Lin TY, Wang F, Lee J, Cheng M, Dall'Era M, Li T, deVere White R, Pan CX, Lam KSSource: Nanotechnology. 2016 Oct 21;27(42):425103. doi: 10.1088/0957-4484/27/42/425103. Epub 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Chemotherapy commonly used in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer is only moderately effective and associated with significant toxicity. There has been no appreciable improvement in overall survival over the last three decades. The goal of this project is to develop and characterize bladder cancer-specific nanometer-scale micelles loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) and determine the anti-tumor activity and toxicity. Micelle-building-material telodendrimers were synthesized through the stepwise conjugation of eight cholic acid units at one terminus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a bladder cancer-specific targeting peptide named PLZ4 at the other terminus. To synthesize disulfide-crosslinked PLZ4 nanomicelles (DC-PNM), cysteine was introduced between the cholic acid and PEG. DC-PNM-PTX was synthesized through the evaporation method by loading PTX in the core. The loading capacity of PTX in DC-PNM was 25% (W/W). The loading efficiency was over 99%. DC-PNM-PTX was spherical with the median size of 25 nm. The stability of DC-PNM-PTX was determined in a solution containing sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS). It was stable in a SDS solution, but dissolved within 5 min after the addition of glutathione at the physiological intracellular concentration of 10 mM. In vivo targeting and anti-tumor activity were determined in immunodeficient mice carrying patient-derived bladder cancer xenografts (PDXs). After intravenous administration, DC-PNM specifically targeted the bladder cancer PDXs, but very little to the lung cancer xenografts in the same mice (p < 0.001). DC-PNM loaded with PTX overcame cisplatin resistance, and improved the median survival from 55 d with free PTX to 69.5 d (p = 0.03) of mice carrying PDXs. In conclusion, DC-PNM remained stable in the SDS solution, specifically targeted the bladder cancer xenografts in vivo, and improved the anti-cancer efficacy of PTX.PMID: 27640220Title: Rethinking N2 disease in the era of uniportal VATS.Authors: Treasure T, De Leyn PSource: Future Oncol. 2016 Sep 19.Abstract: Third Mediterranean Symposium on Thoracic Surgical Oncology, Catania, Italy, 21-22 April 2016 The primary justification for mediastinal lymphadenectomy is that it provides more complete nodal staging to help select best adjuvant treatments. There is a secondary argument that dissection of nodes might remove otherwise unrecognized nodal disease to increase the chance of cure. They have to be thought through again as patients look for less invasive treatments for their cancers such as videothoracoscopy and stereotactic radiotherapy. Evidence from analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data indicated that sampling or dissection can be performed adequately by surgeons using videothoracoscopy but stereotactic radiotherapy of its nature precludes intraoperative lymph node dissection and yet is being promoted as equivalent treatment. Consideration of these issues requires re-examination of the evidence that lymphadenectomy influences survival.PMID: 27640003Title: The ratio of cancer cells to stroma after induction therapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Goto M, Naito M, Saruwatari K, Hisakane K, Kojima M, Fujii S, Kuwata T, Ochiai A, Nomura S, Aokage K, Hishida T, Yoshida J, Yokoi K, Tsuboi M, Ishii GSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 17.Abstract: PURPOSE: Induction therapy induces degenerative changes of various degrees in both cancerous and non-cancerous cells of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effect of induction therapy on histological characteristics, in particular the ratio of residual cancer cells to non-cancerous components, is unknown. METHODS: Seventy-four NSCLC patients treated with induction therapy followed by surgery were enrolled. Residual cancer cells were identified using anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3). We analyzed and quantified the following three factors via digital image analysis; (1) the tumor area containing cancer cells and non-cancerous components (TA), (2) the total area of AE1/AE3 positive cancer cells (TACC), (3) the percentage of TACC to TA (%TACC). These factors were also analyzed in a matched control group (surgery alone, n = 80). RESULTS: The median TACC of the induction therapy group was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.01). In addition, the median %TACC of the induction therapy group (5.9 %) was significantly lower than that of the control group (58.6 %) (p < 0.01). TACC had a strong positive correlation with TA in the control group (r = 0.93), but not in the induction therapy group. Conversely, TACC had a strong positive correlation with %TACC in the induction therapy group (r = 0.95), but not in the control group. CONCLUSION: Unlike the control group, the smaller the total area of residual cancer cells, the higher residual tumor contained non-cancerous components in the induction group, which may be the characteristic histological feature of NSCLC after induction therapy.PMID: 27639947Title: [Limitations of active therapeutic and palliative care in chronic respiratory disease].Authors: Sakhri L, Saint-Raymond C, Quetant S, Pison C, Lagrange E, Hamidfar Roy R, Janssens JP, Maindet-Dominici C, Garrouste-Orgeas M, Levy-Soussan M, Terzi N, Toffart ACSource: Rev Mal Respir. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0761-8425(16)30163-2. doi: 10.1016/j.rmr.2016.06.005.Abstract: The issue of intensive and palliative care in patients with chronic disease frequently arises. This review aims to describe the prognostic factors of chronic respiratory diseases in stable and in acute situations in order to improve the management of these complex situations. The various laws on patients' rights provide a legal framework and define the concept of unreasonable obstinacy. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the most robust decision factors are good knowledge of the respiratory disease, the comorbidities, the history of previous exacerbations and patient preferences. In the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it is necessary to know if there is a prospect of transplantation and to assess the reversibility of the respiratory distress. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, treatment decisions depend on the presence of advance directives about the use of intubation and tracheostomy. For lung cancer patients, general condition, cancer history and the tumor treatment plan are important factors. A multidisciplinary discussion that takes into account the patient's medical history, wishes and the current state of knowledge permits the taking of a coherent decision.PMID: 27639893Title: Roles of immune microenvironment heterogeneity in therapy-associated biomarkers in lung cancer.Authors: Wang L, Zhu B, Zhang M, Wang XSource: Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S1084-9521(16)30292-0. doi: 10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.09.008.Abstract: Lung cancer development is a complex and dynamic progression with cancer cell mutations itself and its' orchestrate with the tumor microenvironment. Targeted therapies have been stated to heterogeneous lung cancer mutations while have a modest consequence. The tumor immune microenvironment influences lung cancer outcome by balancing the suppressive versus cytotoxic responses. The immune microenvironment heterogeneity may play an important role in lung cancer heterogeneity. In this review, we summarized the immune cells, its related cytokines and partial immune genes diversity in tumor microenvironment and its targeted potential mono and combined therapies. It will help us to make better understand the lung cancer heterogeneity and mechanisms of the drug resistance to find a way out.PMID: 27639892Title: Risk of second non-breast cancer among patients treated with and without postoperative radiotherapy for primary breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies including 522,739 patients.Authors: Grantzau T, Overgaard JSource: Radiother Oncol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0167-8140(16)34281-5. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2016.08.017.Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy plays an essential role in early breast cancer treatment, but is also associated with an increased risk of second malignancies decades after the exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched the data-bases Medline/Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and Cinahl, for cohort studies estimating the risk of second non-breast cancer after primary breast cancer. Every included study was to report the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] of second cancers, comparing the risk among either irradiated or unirradiated female breast cancer patients to the risk of the general female population. From each study the SIRs were extracted and then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. SIRs were pooled as an overall estimate and according to time since breast cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: 22 studies were eligible for inclusion, comprising 245,575 irradiated and 277,164 non-irradiated women. Irradiated patients had an overall increased risk of second non-breast cancer, with a SIR of 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.36). For non-irradiated patients the SIR was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.13). For irradiated patients the incidence of second cancers including the lung, esophagus, thyroid and connective tissues progressively increased over time, peaking at 10-15years following breast cancer diagnosis. Summary estimates at 15years after breast cancer irradiation were 1.91 for lung, 2.71 for esophagus, 3.15 for thyroid and 6.54 at 10years for second sarcomas. Non-irradiated patients had no increased risk of second lung or esophagus cancer, neither overall nor over time. For non-irradiated patients' risk of second thyroid cancer (SIR 1.21) and sarcomas (SIR 1.42) were increased overall, but with no remaining risk 10 after breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy for breast cancer is associated with an excess risk of second non-breast cancer, overall and in organs adjacent to the previous treatment fields. The growing number of long-term survivors after breast cancer highlights the need for an improved individualized approach toward identifying patients with an expected benefit from radiation and patients with no added radiation-benefit.PMID: 27639682Title: Tertiary amine mediated targeted therapy against metastatic lung cancer.Authors: Zhou M, Li J, Li C, Guo L, Wang X, He Q, Fu Y, Zhang ZSource: J Control Release. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0168-3659(16)30746-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.09.013.Abstract: In this work, two tertiary amine-derived 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin (DMEP) conjugates (DC and DP) have been designed and synthesized using N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(4-carboxyl benzyl)-1,3-propanediamine (CPDM) and 4-(4-methylpiperazinomethyl)benzoic acid (PBA) as the targeting ligands. Both DC and DP exhibited strong in vitro cytotoxicity against small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Cellular uptake efficiencies of DC and DP in human alveolar type II epithelial cells were significantly enhanced compared to DMEP and etoposide (VP-16), which were demonstrated to be concentration-, time- and energy-dependent. The active transport process of DC and DP might be mediated by organic cation transporters (OCTs). After systemic administration in mice, both DC and DP selectively accumulated in the lung, displaying the highest Cmax and AUC0-t values of all tested tissues. Compared with DMEP and VP-16, DC and DP remarkably reduced the lung weight and the number of lung metastases of B16 melanoma in mice, and further prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Also, DC and DP exhibited comparable levels of cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, DC and DP demonstrated minimum toxicity towards vital organs and reduced gastrointestinal injury compared to DMEP and VP-16. Taken together, tertiary amine-derived moieties such as CPDM and PBA represent an efficient yet safe strategy to achieve lung-targeted drug delivery.PMID: 27639678Title: PD-L1 expression by two complementary diagnostic assays and mRNA in situ hybridization in small cell lung cancer.Authors: Yu H, Batenchuk C, Badzio A, Boyle TA, Czapiewski P, Chan DC, Lu X, Gao D, Ellison K, Kowalewski AA, Rivard CJ, Dziadziuszko R, Zhou C, Hussein M, Richards D, Wilks S, Monte M, Edenfield W, Goldschmidt J, Page R, Ulrich B, Waterhouse D, Close S, Jassem J, Kulig K, Hirsch FRSource: J Thorac Oncol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S1556-0864(16)30947-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jtho.2016.09.002.Abstract: ?PMID: 27639677Title: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) co-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs): A Brief Report.Authors: Barnet M, O'Toole S, Horvath L, Selinger C, Yu B, Ng CC, Boyer M, Cooper WA, Kao SSource: J Thorac Oncol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S1556-0864(16)30946-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jtho.2016.09.001.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The evolution of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has changed the landscape of disease for a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most patients with an EGFR mutation respond to these drugs, however a proportion show limited or no tumour response. We explored the impact of co-mutation (double or multiple mutation), compared with single mutation, of the EGFR gene on response to TKIs in a series of patients with metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the mutation profiles of non-squamous NSCLC tested at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital between 2012 and 2015 by MassArray using the OncoCarta v1.0 panel. Patients with metastatic disease whose tumours had sensitising EGFR mutation(s) were included. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). We used Kaplan-Meier method for PFS and overall survival (OS); log rank test was used to compare groups with and without co-mutation. Multivariable analysis was done for PFS; response rate (RR) was assessed using chi-square and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included and of these 8 (12.9%) had a co-mutation. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 11.5 and 26.3 months respectively. Patients with EGFR co-mutation had significantly shorter median PFS than those with single mutation (5.7 mths versus 12.3 mths; p=0.02). Response rate to TKI was significantly worse in those with co-mutation compared to those without co-mutation (38% versus 89%; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Taking into account the small number of patients in this study, PFS in patients with EGFR co-mutation appeared significantly shorter, and RR significantly lower, than in patients with single mutation. Data from multi-panel testing may identify patient sub-groups who are likely to respond poorly to standard treatment. Clarification of these sub-groups may improve patient care.PMID: 27639644Title: Overexpression of pro-gastrin releasing peptide promotes the cell proliferation and progression in small cell lung cancer.Authors: Gong Z, Lu R, Xie S, Jiang M, Liu K, Xiao R, Shen J, Wang Y, Guo LSource: Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2016 Sep 15. pii: S0006-291X(16)31526-1. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.066.Abstract: Pro-gastrin releasing peptide (ProGRP) plays the role of oncogene in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, we aim to explore the biological function of ProGRP in SCLC cells and its potential mechanism. Expression of ProGRP in SCLC tissues and cell lines were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, respectively. The transduced cell lines with ProGRP down-regulation were established using RNA interference technology. Cell viability, cologenic, apoptosis-associated assay and the biomarker levels determination for cell supernatant were performed in the transduced cells to elucidate the biological functions and mechanisms of ProGRP in SCLC cells. Our data showed that ProGRP protein was demonstrated a higher level in SCLC tissues and cells compared with the control, and its diagnostic efficiency was better than NSE, further, the higher levels of ProGRP were detected in the patients with extensive disease stage (P < 0.05), were also the unfavorable factor to the prognosis of SCLC patients. Additionally, the concentration of serum ProGRP is a useful biomarker in disease-monitoring of the patients with SCLC. Down-regulation of ProGRP significantly reduced SCLC cell growth, repressed colony formation, but increased cancer cell apoptosis. Additionally, repression of ProGRP also induced change in the cell cycle and output of NSE. Our data indicated that ProGRP serve as the useful biomarker in the management of SCLC and might be a potential therapeutic target.PMID: 27639620Title: Results of surgery for pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Experience in a referral center.Authors: Gonzalez-Castillo A, Biondo S, Garcia-Granero A, Cambray M, Martinez-Villacampa M, Kreisler ESource: Cir Esp. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0009-739X(16)30127-0. doi: 10.1016/j.ciresp.2016.08.003.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The only curative treatment of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer is radical resection. The aim of this paper is to analyze our experience in surgery for local recurrence of rectal cancer. METHODS: We performed a descriptive retrospective analysis of patients treated with curative intent for local recurrence of rectal cancer from May 2000 to January 2014. The presence of resectable liver or lung metastases was not an exclusion criterion. The descriptive results, overall survival and disease free survival are presented. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included. In 18 patients an abdomino-perineal resection of the remaining rectum was performed. Two of them included excision of lower sacral vertebrae, while in 17 patients, sphincter sparing surgery was performed. The most frequent postoperative complications were pelvic collection and postoperative ileus. Seven patients required reoperation and one patient died. Overall survival at one year was 91.2%, at 2 years 75.6% and at 5 years 37%. CONCLUSIONS: Local recurrence of rectal cancer is a disease with high curability rate. The only curative option is radical surgery, with acceptable mortality.PMID: 27639429Title: Nrf2 but not autophagy inhibition is associated with the survival of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor non-small cell lung cancer cells.Authors: Zhou Y, Li Y, Ni HM, Ding WX, Zhong HSource: Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S0041-008X(16)30268-X. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2016.09.010.Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Icotinib and Gefitinib are two epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have been used to treat NSCLC. While it is well known that mutations of EGFR can affect the sensitivity of NSCLC to the EGFR-TKI, other mechanisms may also be adopted by lung cancer cells to develop resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. Cancer cells can use multiple adaptive mechanisms such as activation of autophagy and Nrf2 to protect against various stresses and chemotherapeutic drugs. Whether autophagy or Nrf2 activation contributes to the resistance of NSCLC to EGFR-TKI treatment in wild-type EGFR NSCLC cells remains elusive. In the present study, we confirmed that Icotinib and Gefitinib induced apoptosis in EGFR mutant HCC827 but not in EGFR wild-type A549 NSCLC cells. Icotinib and Gefitinib did not induce autophagic flux or inhibit mTOR in A549 cells. Moreover, suppression of autophagy by chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, did not affect Icotinib- or Gefitinib-induced cell death in A549 cells. In contrast, Brusatol, an Nrf2 inhibitor, significantly suppressed the cell survival of A549 cells. However, Brusatol did not further sensitize A549 cells to EGFR TKI-induced cell death. Results from this study suggest that inhibition of Nrf2 can decrease cell vitality of EGFR wild-type A549 cells independent of autophagy.PMID: 27639426Title: Inhibition of autophagy by andrographolide resensitizes cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma cells via activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway.Authors: Mi S, Xiang G, Yuwen D, Gao J, Guo W, Wu X, Wu X, Sun Y, Su Y, Shen Y, Xu QSource: Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2016 Sep 14;310:78-86. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2016.09.009.Abstract: Resistance to cisplatin is a major obstacle for the success of non-small cell lung cancer therapy. The mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance are not fully understood. In this study, we found that the increase of basal auotophagy accompanied the development of cisplatin resistance. Meanwhile the blockade of the Akt/mTOR pathway occurred in the process. Inhibition of this pathway was induced by cisplatin treatment in the resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Andrographolide, a natural diterpenoid, promoted the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling by downregulating PTEN and suppressed autophagy, which subsequently resensitized the resistant cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. Cisplatin treatment in combination with andrographolide significantly prevented the growth of the resistant cells in vivo. These results highlight the involvement of autophagy in cisplatin-resistance development and suggest that inhibition of autophagy via tuning the Akt/mTOR signaling could be a promising strategy in the therapy for cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer.PMID: 27639369Title: Synthesis and apoptosis inducing studies of triazole linked 3-benzylidene isatin derivatives.Authors: Nagarsenkar A, Guntuku L, Guggilapu SD, K DB, Gannoju S, Naidu VG, Bathini NBSource: Eur J Med Chem. 2016 Sep 4;124:782-793. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.09.009.Abstract: In our venture towards the development of effective cytotoxic agents, a panel of triazole linked 3-benzylidene isatin hybrids were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Mass spectral analysis. All the newly synthesized target compounds were assessed against DU145 (prostate), PC-3 (prostate), MDA-MB-231 (breast), BT549 (breast), A549 (lung) and HeLa (cervical) human cancer cell lines by employing MTT assay for their cytotoxic potential. Significantly, compound Z-8l was found to be most potent amongst all the tested compounds with an IC50 value of (3.7 +/- 0.05 muM) on DU145 cells. The most active compound (Z-8l) was also tested on RWPE-1 (normal prostate) cells and was found to be safe compared to the DU145 cells. The influence of the cytotoxic compound Z-8l on the cell cycle distribution was assessed on the DU145 cell line, exhibiting a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Additionally, treatment with compound Z-8l caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim) in DU145 cells. Moreover, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, DAPI nuclear staining, DCFDA staining and annexin V binding assay confirmed that compound Z-8l can induce cell apoptosis in DU145 cells. Western blotting was performed to examine the appearance of active forms of cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl2 and PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase), indicator proteins of apoptosis in DU145 cells; the study confirmed the triggering of mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathway upon exposure of compound Z-8l.PMID: 27639313Title: Lung adenocarcinomas: correlation of computed tomography and pathology findings.Authors: Cohen JG, Reymond E, Jankowski A, Brambilla E, Arbib F, Lantuejoul S, Ferretti GRSource: Diagn Interv Imaging. 2016 Sep 14. pii: S2211-5684(16)30180-2. doi: 10.1016/j.diii.2016.06.021.Abstract: Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. Recent lung adenocarcinoma classifications from the International Association for the Study of Lung cancer, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ETS/ERS, 2011) and World Health Organization (WHO, 2015) define a wide range of adenocarcinoma types and subtypes featuring different prognosis and management. This spectrum of lesions translates into various CT presentations and features, which generally show good correlation with histopathology, stressing the key role of the radiologist in the diagnosis and management of those patients. This review aims at helping radiologists to understand the basics of the up-to-date adenocarcinoma pathological classifications, radio-pathological correlations and how to use them in the clinical setting, as well as other imaging-related correlations (radiogenomics, quantitative analysis, PET-CT).PMID: 27639294Title: Dose and Fractionation in Radiation Therapy of Curative Intent for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.Authors: Ramroth J, Cutter DJ, Darby SC, Higgins GS, McGale P, Partridge M, Taylor CWSource: Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2016 Jul 25. pii: S0360-3016(16)32897-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.07.022.Abstract: PURPOSE: The optimum dose and fractionation in radiation therapy of curative intent for non-small cell lung cancer remains uncertain. We undertook a published data meta-analysis of randomized trials to examine whether radiation therapy regimens with higher time-corrected biologically equivalent doses resulted in longer survival, either when given alone or when given with chemotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible studies were randomized comparisons of 2 or more radiation therapy regimens, with other treatments identical. Median survival ratios were calculated for each comparison and pooled. RESULTS: 3795 patients in 25 randomized comparisons of radiation therapy dose were studied. The median survival ratio, higher versus lower corrected dose, was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.22) when radiation therapy was given alone and 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.97) when it was given with concurrent chemotherapy (P for difference=.001). In comparisons of radiation therapy given alone, the survival benefit increased with increasing dose difference between randomized treatment arms (P for trend=.004). The benefit increased with increasing dose in the lower-dose arm (P for trend=.01) without reaching a level beyond which no further survival benefit was achieved. The survival benefit did not differ significantly between randomized comparisons where the higher-dose arm was hyperfractionated and those where it was not. There was heterogeneity in the median survival ratio by geographic region (P<.001), average age at randomization (P<.001), and year trial started (P for trend=.004), but not for proportion of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (P=.2). CONCLUSIONS: In trials with concurrent chemotherapy, higher radiation therapy doses resulted in poorer survival, possibly caused, at least in part, by high levels of toxicity. Where radiation therapy was given without chemotherapy, progressively higher radiation therapy doses resulted in progressively longer survival, and no upper dose level was found above which there was no further benefit. These findings support the consideration of further radiation therapy dose escalation trials, making use of modern treatment methods to reduce toxicity.PMID: 27639278Title: Lung and stomach cancer associations with groundwater radon in North Carolina, USA.Authors: Messier KP, Serre MLSource: Int J Epidemiol. 2016 Sep 17. pii: dyw128.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The risk of indoor air radon for lung cancer is well studied, but the risks of groundwater radon for both lung and stomach cancer are much less studied, and with mixed results. METHODS: Geomasked and geocoded stomach and lung cancer cases in North Carolina from 1999 to 2009 were obtained from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Models for the association with groundwater radon and multiple confounders were implemented at two scales: (i) an ecological model estimating cancer incidence rates at the census tract level; and (ii) a case-only logistic model estimating the odds that individual cancer cases are members of local cancer clusters. RESULTS: For the lung cancer incidence rate model, groundwater radon is associated with an incidence rate ratio of 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.06] for every 100 Bq/l increase in census tract averaged concentration. For the cluster membership models, groundwater radon exposure results in an odds ratio for lung cancer of 1.13 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.23) and for stomach cancer of 1.24 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.49), which means groundwater radon, after controlling for multiple confounders and spatial auto-correlation, increases the odds that lung and stomach cancer cases are members of their respective cancer clusters. CONCLUSION: Our study provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between groundwater radon exposure and lung cancer incidence rates. The cluster membership model results find groundwater radon increases the odds that both lung and stomach cancer cases occur within their respective cancer clusters. The results corroborate previous biokinetic and mortality studies that groundwater radon is associated with increased risk for lung and stomach cancer.PMID: 27638907Title: Predicting neutropenia risk in patients with cancer using electronic data.Authors: Pawloski PA, Thomas AJ, Kane S, Vazquez-Benitez G, Shapiro GR, Lyman GHSource: J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2016 Sep 16. pii: ocw131. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocw131.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Clinical guidelines recommending the use of myeloid growth factors are largely based on the prescribed chemotherapy regimen. The guidelines suggest that oncologists consider patient-specific characteristics when prescribing granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis; however, a mechanism to quantify individual patient risk is lacking. Readily available electronic health record (EHR) data can provide patient-specific information needed for individualized neutropenia risk estimation. An evidence-based, individualized neutropenia risk estimation algorithm has been developed. This study evaluated the automated extraction of EHR chemotherapy treatment data and externally validated the neutropenia risk prediction model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed breast, colorectal, lung, lymphoid, or ovarian cancer who received the first cycle of a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen from 2008 to 2013 were recruited from a single cancer clinic. Electronically extracted EHR chemotherapy treatment data were validated by chart review. Neutropenia risk stratification was conducted and risk model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination. RESULTS: Chemotherapy treatment data electronically extracted from the EHR were verified by chart review. The neutropenia risk prediction tool classified 126 patients (57%) as being low risk for febrile neutropenia, 44 (20%) as intermediate risk, and 51 (23%) as high risk. The model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test = 0.24). Discrimination was adequate and slightly less than in the original internal validation (c-statistic 0.75 vs 0.81). CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy treatment data were electronically extracted from the EHR successfully. The individualized neutropenia risk prediction model performed well in our retrospective external cohort.PMID: 27638861Title: Alkylating agent induced NRF2 blocks endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis via control of glutathione pools and protein thiol homeostasis.Authors: Zanotto-Filho A, Masamsetti VP, Loranc E, Tonapi SS, Gorthi A, Bernard X, Goncalves RM, Moreira JC, Chen Y, Bishop AJSource: Mol Cancer Ther. 2016 Sep 16. pii: molcanther.0271.2016.Abstract: Alkylating agents are a commonly used cytotoxic class of anticancer drugs. Understanding the mechanisms whereby cells respond to these drugs is key to identify means to improve therapy while reducing toxicity. By integrating genome-wide gene expression profiling, protein analysis and functional cell validation, we herein demonstrated a direct relationship between NRF2 and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress pathways in response to alkylating agents, which is coordinated by the availability of glutathione (GSH) pools. GSH is essential for both drug detoxification and protein thiol homeostasis within the ER, thus inhibiting ER stress induction and promoting survival; an effect independent of its antioxidant role. NRF2 accumulation induced by alkylating agents resulted in increased GSH synthesis via GCLC/GCLM enzyme, and interfering with this NRF2 response by either NRF2 knockdown or GCLC/GCLM inhibition with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) caused accumulation of damaged proteins within the ER, leading to PERK-dependent apoptosis. Conversely, upregulation of NRF2, through KEAP1 depletion or NRF2-myc overexpression, or increasing GSH levels with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or glutathione-ethyl-ester (GSH-E), decreased ER stress and abrogated alkylating agents-induced cell death. Based on these results, we identified a subset of lung and head-and-neck carcinomas with mutations in either KEAP1 or NRF2/NFE2L2 genes that correlate with NRF2 targets overexpression and poor survival. In KEAP1 mutant cancer cells, NRF2 knockdown and GSH depletion increased cell sensitivity via ER stress induction in a mechanism specific to alkylating drugs. Overall, we show that the NRF2-GSH influence on ER homeostasis implicates defects in NRF2-GSH or ER stress machineries as affecting alkylating therapy toxicity.PMID: 27638773Title: Cancer incidence in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.Authors: Duarte CW, Black AW, Lucas FL, Vary CPSource: J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder characterized by deficiency in endoglin, an angiogenic protein. We previously showed that HHT, in which systemic endoglin expression is reduced, was associated with better survival outcomes in cancer patients (Duarte et al. in Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 23:117-125, 2014). Here, we evaluated whether HHT was associated with reduced cancer incidence. METHODS: A matched case-control analysis using SEER Medicare was conducted to evaluate the effect of HHT on diagnosis with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 (n = 633,162). Cancer and non-cancer patients were matched on age, sex, SEER registry region, and length of the ascertainment period for HHT. We assessed crude association using a McNemar's test and then adjusted for demographic variables, cancer type, cancer stage, comorbidities, and ascertainment period with a conditional logistic regression model for cancer incidence. RESULTS: The McNemar's test showed no significant association between HHT and cancer incidence (p = 0.74). Adjusting for covariates with the conditional logistic regression model did not change the result [HHT odds ratio 0.978; 95 % CI (0.795, 1.204)]. The lack of association between HHT and cancer incidence is unexpected given the previously discovered significant association between HHT and improved survival outcomes (Duarte et al. in Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 23:117-125, 2014). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the protective effect of reduced systemic endoglin expression in cancer is specific to cancer progression through its effect on vascularization and other stromal effects but does not extend to cancer initiation.PMID: 27638768Title: Lethal lung hypoplasia and vascular defects in mice with conditional Foxf1 overexpression.Authors: Dharmadhikari AV, Sun JJ, Gogolewski K, Carofino BL, Ustiyan V, Hill M, Majewski T, Szafranski P, Justice MJ, Ray RS, Dickinson ME, Kalinichenko VV, Gambin A, Stankiewicz PSource: Biol Open. 2016 Sep 16. pii: bio.019208. doi: 10.1242/bio.019208.Abstract: FOXF1 heterozygous point mutations and genomic deletions have been reported in newborns with a neonatally lethal lung developmental disorder, Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV). However, no gain-of-function mutations in FOXF1 have been identified yet in human disease. To study the effects of FOXF1 overexpression in lung development, we generated a Foxf1 overexpression mouse model by knocking in a Cre-inducible Foxf1 allele into the ROSA26 (R26) locus. The mice were phenotyped using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), head-out plethysmography, ChIP-seq and transcriptome analyses, immunohistochemistry, and lung histopathology. Thirty-five percent of heterozygous R26-Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-Foxf1 E15.5 embryos exhibit subcutaneous edema, hemorrhages and die perinatally when bred to Tie2-cre mice, which targets Foxf1 overexpression to endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Histopathological and micro-CT evaluations revealed that R26Foxf1; Tie2-cre embryos have immature lungs with a diminished vascular network. Neonates exhibited respiratory deficits verified by detailed plethysmography studies. ChIP-seq and transcriptome analyses in E18.5 lungs identified Sox11, Ghr, Ednrb, and Slit2 as potential downstream targets of FOXF1. Our study shows that overexpression of the highly dosage sensitive Foxf1 impairs lung development and causes vascular abnormalities. This has important clinical implications when considering potential gene therapy approaches to treat disorders of FOXF1 abnormal dosage, such as ACDMPV.PMID: 27638404Title: Protective effects of oridonin on the sepsis in mice.Authors: Zhao YJ, Lv H, Xu PB, Zhu MM, Liu Y, Miao CH, Zhu YSource: Kaohsiung J Med Sci. 2016 Sep;32(9):452-7. doi: 10.1016/j.kjms.2016.07.013. Epub 2016 Aug 25.Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of oridonin (ORI) on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice weighing 22-30 g and aged 8-10 weeks were randomly assigned to three groups: Sham group, CLP group, or CLP plus ORI group. In the CLP group and ORI group, CLP was induced, and intraperitoneal injection of normal saline and oridonin (100 mug/kg) was conducted, respectively. The survival rate was determined within the following 7 days. The blood, liver, and lung were collected at 24 hours after injury. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the lung, detection of lung wet-to-dry ratio, and serum cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin [IL]-6), and examination of intraperitoneal and blood bacterial clearance were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy. Results showed that ORI treatment significantly reduced the lung wet-to-dry ratio, decreased serum TNF-alpha and IL-6, and improved liver pathology compared with the CLP group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the intraperitoneal and blood bacterial clearance increased markedly after ORI treatment (p < 0.05). The 7-day survival rate in the ORI group was also dramatically higher than in the CLP group (p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that ORI can attenuate liver and lung injuries and elevate bacterial clearance to increase the survival rate of sepsis mice.PMID: 27638340Title: Zinc and zinc-containing biomolecules in childhood brain tumors.Authors: Hrabeta J, Eckschlager T, Stiborova M, Heger Z, Krizkova S, Adam VSource: J Mol Med (Berl). 2016 Sep 16.Abstract: Zinc ions are essential cofactors of a wide range of enzymes, transcription factors, and other regulatory proteins. Moreover, zinc is also involved in cellular signaling and enzymes inhibition. Zinc dysregulation, deficiency, over-supply, and imbalance in zinc ion transporters regulation are connected with various diseases including cancer. A zinc ion pool is maintained by two types of proteins: (i) zinc-binding proteins, which act as a buffer and intracellular donors of zinc and (ii) zinc transporters responsible for zinc fluxes into/from cells and organelles. The decreased serum zinc ion levels have been identified in patients suffering from various cancer diseases, including head and neck tumors and breast, prostate, liver, and lung cancer. On the contrary, increased zinc ion levels have been found in breast cancer and other malignant tissues. Zinc metalloproteomes of a majority of tumors including brain ones are still not yet fully understood. Current knowledge show that zinc ion levels and detection of certain zinc-containing proteins may be utilized for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In addition, these proteins can also be promising therapeutic targets. The aim of the present work is an overview of the importance of zinc ions, zinc transporters, and zinc-containing proteins in brain tumors, which are, after leukemia, the second most common type of childhood cancer and the second leading cause of death in children after accidents.PMID: 27638103Title: Radiomics and its emerging role in lung cancer research, imaging biomarkers and clinical management: State of the art.Authors: Lee G, Lee HY, Park H, Schiebler ML, van Beek EJ, Ohno Y, Seo JB, Leung ASource: Eur J Radiol. 2016 Sep 10. pii: S0720-048X(16)30274-1. doi: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2016.09.005.Abstract: With the development of functional imaging modalities we now have the ability to study the microenvironment of lung cancer and its genomic instability. Radiomics is defined as the use of automated or semi-automated post-processing and analysis of large amounts of quantitative imaging features that can be derived from medical images. The automated generation of these analytical features helps to quantify a number of variables in the imaging assessment of lung malignancy. These imaging features include: tumor spatial complexity, elucidation of the tumor genomic heterogeneity and composition, subregional identification in terms of tumor viability or aggressiveness, and response to chemotherapy and/or radiation. Therefore, a radiomic approach can help to reveal unique information about tumor behavior. Currently available radiomic features can be divided into four major classes: (a) morphological, (b) statistical, (c) regional, and (d) model-based. Each category yields quantitative parameters that reflect specific aspects of a tumor. The major challenge is to integrate radiomic data with clinical, pathological, and genomic information to decode the different types of tissue biology. There are many currently available radiomic studies on lung cancer for which there is a need to summarize the current state of the art.PMID: 27637890Title: The human CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab shows anti-tumor activity and hampers leukemia-microenvironment interactions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Authors: Matas-Cespedes A, Vidal-Crespo A, Rodriguez V, Villamor N, Delgado J, Gine E, Roca-Ho H, Menendez P, Campo E, Lopez-Guillermo A, Colomer D, Roue G, Wiestner A, Parren PW, Doshi P, Lammerts-van Bueren JJ, Perez-Galan PSource: Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 16. pii: clincanres.2095.2015.Abstract: PURPOSE: To establish a proof-of-concept for the efficacy of the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab in the poor prognosis CD38+ CLL subtype. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mechanism of action of daratumumab was assessed in CLL primary cells and cell lines using peripheral blood mononuclear cells to analyze antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), murine and human macrophages to study antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP) or human serum to analyze complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The effect of daratumumab on CLL cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix was characterized. Daratumumab activity was validated in two in vivo models. RESULTS: Daratumumab demonstrated efficient lysis of patient-derived CLL cells and cell lines by ADCC in vitro and ADCP both in vitro and in vivo, while exhibited negligible CDC in these cells. To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of daratumumab in CLL, we generated a disseminated CLL mouse model with the CD38+ MEC2 cell line and CLL patient derived xenografts (CLL-PDX). Daratumumab significantly prolonged overall survival of MEC2 mice, completely eliminated cells from the infiltrated organs and significantly reduced disease burden in the spleen of CLL-PDX. The effect of daratumumab on patient-derived CLL cell dissemination was demonstrated in vitro by its effect on CXCL12-induced migration and in vivo by interfering with CLL cell homing to spleen in NSG mice. Daratumumab also reduced adhesion of CLL cells to VCAM-1, accompanied by down-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9. CONCLUSIONS: These unique and substantial effects of daratumumab on CLL viability and dissemination support the investigation of its use in a clinical setting of CLL.PMID: 27637888Title: Mutant p53 Together with TGFbeta Signaling Influence Organ-Specific Hematogenous Colonization Patterns of Pancreatic Cancer.Authors: Zhong Y, Macgregor-Das AM, Saunders T, Whittle M, Makohon-Moore A, Kohutek Z, Poling J, Herbst B, Javier B, Cope L, Leach SD, Hingorani SR, Iacobuzio-Donahue CASource: Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 16. pii: clincanres.1615.2015.Abstract: PURPOSE: TP53 and the TGFbeta pathway are major mediators of pancreatic cancer metastasis. The mechanisms by which they cause hematogenous metastasis have not been fully explored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: KPC (LSL-KRASG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Ptf1aCre/+) mice were generated and the frequency and morphology of organ-specific hematogenous metastases compared to that seen in KPTC and KTC littermates (Tgfbr2+/-). Key findings were validated in primary cells from each genotype and samples of human pancreatic cancer liver metastases. RESULTS: The frequency of hematogenous metastasis in KPTC mice was significantly lower than for KPC mice (41% vs 68%, p<0.05), largely due to a reduction in liver metastases. No differences were found between KPC and KPTC lung metastases whereas liver metastases in KPTC mice showed a profound extravasation deficiency characterized by sinusoidal growth and lack of desmoplastic stroma. Analogous findings were confirmed in liver samples from patients indicating their clinical relevance. Portal vein colonization as a direct mode of access to the liver was observed in both mice and humans. Secretome analyses of KPC cells revealed an abundance of secreted prometastatic mediators including Col6A1 and Lcn2 that promoted early steps of metastatic colonization. These mediators were overexpressed in primary tumors but not metastases suggesting the ability to colonize is in part developed within the primary site, a phenomenon we refer to as the "Cinderella effect". CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a novel paradigm for understanding pancreatic cancer metastasis and the observed clinical latencies of liver versus lung metastases specifically.PMID: 27637832Title: ESPEN guidelines on nutrition in cancer patients.Authors: Arends J, Bachmann P, Baracos V, Barthelemy N, Bertz H, Bozzetti F, Fearon K, Hutterer E, Isenring E, Kaasa S, Krznaric Z, Laird B, Larsson M, Laviano A, Muhlebach S, Muscaritoli M, Oldervoll L, Ravasco P, Solheim T, Strasser F, de van der Schueren M, Preiser JCSource: Clin Nutr. 2016 Aug 6. pii: S0261-5614(16)30181-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2016.07.015.Abstract: Cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the number of new cases is expected to rise significantly over the next decades. At the same time, all types of cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and pharmacological therapies are improving in sophistication, precision and in the power to target specific characteristics of individual cancers. Thus, while many cancers may still not be cured they may be converted to chronic diseases. All of these treatments, however, are impeded or precluded by the frequent development of malnutrition and metabolic derangements in cancer patients, induced by the tumor or by its treatment. These evidence-based guidelines were developed to translate current best evidence and expert opinion into recommendations for multi-disciplinary teams responsible for identification, prevention, and treatment of reversible elements of malnutrition in adult cancer patients. The guidelines were commissioned and financially supported by ESPEN and by the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), an EU level initiative. Members of the guideline group were selected by ESPEN to include a range of professions and fields of expertise. We searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and comparative studies based on clinical questions according to the PICO format. The evidence was evaluated and merged to develop clinical recommendations using the GRADE method. Due to the deficits in the available evidence, relevant still open questions were listed and should be addressed by future studies. Malnutrition and a loss of muscle mass are frequent in cancer patients and have a negative effect on clinical outcome. They may be driven by inadequate food intake, decreased physical activity and catabolic metabolic derangements. To screen for, prevent, assess in detail, monitor and treat malnutrition standard operating procedures, responsibilities and a quality control process should be established at each institution involved in treating cancer patients. All cancer patients should be screened regularly for the risk or the presence of malnutrition. In all patients - with the exception of end of life care - energy and substrate requirements should be met by offering in a step-wise manner nutritional interventions from counseling to parenteral nutrition. However, benefits and risks of nutritional interventions have to be balanced with special consideration in patients with advanced disease. Nutritional care should always be accompanied by exercise training. To counter malnutrition in patients with advanced cancer there are few pharmacological agents and pharmaconutrients with only limited effects. Cancer survivors should engage in regular physical activity and adopt a prudent diet.PMID: 27637725Title: Adaptive Dose Escalation using Serial Four-dimensional Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Scans during Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.Authors: Yap ML, Sun A, Higgins J, Clarke K, Marshall A, Becker N, Le LW, Vines DC, Bezjak A, Bissonnette JPSource: Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2016 Sep 13. pii: S0936-6555(16)30274-6. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2016.08.011.Abstract: AIMS: Computed tomography (CT)-based radiotherapy dose escalation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) has had limited success. In this planning study, we investigated the potential for adaptive dose escalation using respiratory-gated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans (4DPET/4DCT) acquired before and during a course of chemoradiotherapy (CRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with LA-NSCLC receiving curative intent CRT. Radiotherapy was delivered using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using the week 0 4DCT scan. Three alternative, dose-escalated IMRT plans were developed offline based on the week 0, 2 and 4 4DPET/4DCT scans. The FDG-avid primary (PET-T) and nodal disease (PET-N) volumes defined by the 50% of maximum standard uptake value threshold were dose escalated to as high as possible while respecting organ at risk constraints. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were recruited, 27 completing all scans. Twenty-five patients (93%) were boosted successfully above the clinical plan doses at week 0, 23 (85%) at week 2 and 20 (74%) at week 4. The median dose received by 95% of the planning target volume (D95) at week 0, 2 and 4 to PET-T were 74.4 Gy, 75.3 Gy and 74.1 Gy and to PET-N were 74.3 Gy, 71.0 Gy and 69.5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Using 18F-FDG-4DPET/4DCT, it is feasible to dose escalate both primary and nodal disease in most patients. Choosing week 0 images to plan a course with an integrated boost to PET-avid disease allows for more patients to be successfully dose escalated with the highest boost dose.PMID: 27637724Title: Functional Image-guided Radiotherapy Planning for Normal Lung Avoidance: a Review.Authors: Ireland RH, Tahir BA, Wild JM, Lee CE, Hatton MQSource: Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2016 Sep 13. pii: S0936-6555(16)30236-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2016.08.005.Abstract: For patients with lung cancer undergoing curative intent radiotherapy, functional lung imaging can be incorporated into treatment planning to modify the dose distribution within non-target volume lung by differentiation of lung regions that are functionally defective or viable. This concept of functional image-guided lung avoidance treatment planning has been investigated with several imaging modalities, primarily single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), but also hyperpolarised gas magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT)-based measures of lung biomechanics. Here, we review the application of each of these modalities, review practical issues of lung avoidance implementation, including image registration and the role of both ventilation and perfusion imaging, and provide guidelines for reporting of future lung avoidance planning studies.PMID: 27637599Title: Small Cell Lung Cancer Presenting as a Cardiac Mass with Embolic Phenomena.Authors: Duncan MD, Swinburne AJ, Sahni S, Zuckerman JE, Hacobian MSource: Am J Med. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S0002-9343(16)30915-9. doi: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.08.028.Abstract: ?PMID: 27637559Title: A Comparison of Survival by Site of Metastatic Resection in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.Authors: Lee-Ying R, Bernard B, Gresham G, Chen L, Speers C, Kennecke HF, Lim HJ, Cheung WY, Renouf DJSource: Clin Colorectal Cancer. 2016 Aug 9. pii: S1533-0028(16)30125-6. doi: 10.1016/j.clcc.2016.07.018.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metastatic resection (MR) of liver-limited disease is an effective therapy for selected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Despite limited data, this approach has been expanded to include MR of other sites, such as the lung, locoregional, and other distant disease (ODD). We performed a population-based study of patients with mCRC who had undergone MR and compared survival between MR of the liver and MR of other sites. METHODS: Patients with mCRC who were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency between 1995 and 2010 were reviewed. Patients were included if they had an R0 MR with a negative margin and no residual disease. The site of MR was classified according to collaborative staging criteria as liver, lung, locoregional, or ODD. Median overall survival (mOS) was assessed with Kaplan-Meier methods and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to compare mOS, while adjusting for known prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 2082 patients with mCRC were identified, of whom 257 underwent R0 MR. Sites of MR included liver (65%), lung (16%), locoregional (5%), and ODD (14%). The mOS of liver, lung, locoregional, and ODD were 48.0, 42.8, 37.2, and 26.2 months, respectively (P = .087). On multivariate analysis, only MR of ODD had a significantly different survival estimate than MR of the liver (hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.80; P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with limited lung and locoregional disease seem to have a comparable survival advantage from MR as patients with liver-limited metastases.PMID: 27637426Title: ALK mutation and inhibition in lung cancer.Authors: Le T, Gerber DESource: Semin Cancer Biol. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S1044-579X(16)30040-2. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2016.08.007.Abstract: The advent of precision medicine in non-small cell lung cancer has remarkably altered the direction of research and improved clinical outcomes. The identification of molecular subsets with differential response to targeted therapies began with the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor mutated tumors in subsets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Emboldened by unprecedented response rates to kinase inhibitors seen in that subset, the oncologic community searched for other molecular subsets featuring oncogene addiction. An early result of this search was the discovery of NSCLC driven by activating rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. In an astoundingly brief period following the recognition of ALK-positive NSCLC, details of the biology, clinicopathologic features, development of targeted inhibitors, mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and new generations of treatment were elucidated. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathologic features, diagnostic approach, treatment options, resistance mechanisms, and future research areas for ALK-positive NSCLC.PMID: 27637408Title: Effect of Angiotensin System Inhibitors on Survival in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Authors: Menter AR, Carroll NM, Sakoda LC, Delate T, Hornbrook MC, Jain RK, Kushi LH, Quinn VP, Ritzwoller DPSource: Clin Lung Cancer. 2016 Aug 20. pii: S1525-7304(16)30188-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cllc.2016.07.008.Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Preclinical studies suggest that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASI) and bevacizumab improve tumor perfusion and chemotherapy efficacy. We performed a retrospective study to examine whether concomitant ASI use during carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) without or with bevacizumab (CPB) was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced nonsquamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, adult patients diagnosed with stage IIIB or IV NS-NSCLC between 2005 and 2011 were identified from tumor registries at 1 of 4 Kaiser Permanente regions. Survival differences between those who did and did not receive ASIs concomitant with chemotherapy (CP or CPB) were assessed using propensity score-matched proportional hazard models. OS was measured from the initiation of chemotherapy until death, disenrollment, or December 31, 2012. RESULTS: Of the 1465 CP and 348 CPB patients included, 273 (19%) and 78 (22%), respectively, received concomitant ASI. For CP patients with and without concomitant ASI exposure, median OS was 12.0 and 8.4 months, respectively (crude hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.84). For CPB patients, the comparable median OS was 14.9 and 11.9 months, respectively (crude HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02). Using propensity score-matched cohorts, the HR for concomitant ASI use was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88) for CP patients and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.51-1.21) for CPB patients. CONCLUSION: Concomitant ASI receipt during CP or CPB therapy for NS-NSCLC was associated with improved survival, although the association was only statistically significant in the CP group.PMID: 27637324Title: [A not so poorly-defined opacity].Authors: Bravos E, Bayle-Bleuez S, Wahart A, Lacheze R, Forest F, Guichard JB, Bertoletti LSource: Rev Mal Respir. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S0761-8425(16)30168-1. doi: 10.1016/j.rmr.2016.05.011.Abstract: A 60-year-old patient was under follow-up for pulmonary hypertension consistent with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. During his follow-up, a parenchymal opacity was discovered. We describe the management of the suspicion of lung cancer, highlighting the modification of the conventional diagnostic and therapeutic strategy on account of the pulmonary hypertension. Chest physicians should be able to adapt their diagnostic and therapeutic management in the case of neoplasia in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.PMID: 27637288Title: Endosonography Versus Mediastinoscopy in Mediastinal Staging of Lung Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Authors: Sehgal IS, Dhooria S, Aggarwal AN, Behera D, Agarwal RSource: Ann Thorac Surg. 2016 Sep 13. pii: S0003-4975(16)30619-1. doi: 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.05.110.Abstract: Whether endosonography can replace mediastinoscopy as the initial procedure for mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Herein, we perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies (both procedures performed in same subjects) comparing the two procedures. Nine studies (960 subjects) were identified. The pooled risk-difference of the sensitivity of endosonography versus mediastinoscopy in observational studies and randomized controlled trials was 0.11 (95% confidence interval, -0.07 to 0.29) and 0.11 (95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.25), respectively suggesting equivalence of the two procedures. The complication rate was significantly lower with endosonographic procedures. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration/endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration was found to have similar yield but lower complication rate compared to mediastinoscopy in the initial mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer.PMID: 27637138Title: The world's first single-room proton therapy facility: Two-year experience.Authors: Contreras J, Zhao T, Perkins S, Sun B, Goddu S, Mutic S, Bottani B, Endicott S, Michalski J, Robinson C, Tsien C, Huang J, Fischer-Valuck BW, Hallahan D, Klein E, Bradley JSource: Pract Radiat Oncol. 2016 Jul 9. pii: S1879-8500(16)30114-X. doi: 10.1016/j.prro.2016.07.003.Abstract: PURPOSE: This is a review of our 2-year experience with the first single-gantry proton therapy (PT) system. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients were consented to participate on an institutional review board-approved prospective patient registry between December 2013 and December 2015. PT was delivered in a single-room facility using a synchrocyclotron with proton beam energy of 250 MeV. The dataset was interrogated for demographics, diagnosis, treatment modality, and clinical trial involvement. Cases were classified as simple or complex based on fields used and immobilization. The volume of photon patients treated in our department was collected between January 2011 and December 2015 to evaluate the impact of PT on our photon patient volume. RESULTS: A total of 278 patients were treated with PT, including 228 (82%) adults and 50 (18%) pediatric cases. PT patients traveled a mean distance of 83.3 miles compared with 47.4 miles for photon patients queried in 2015. Rationale for treatment included reirradiation (20%), involvement in prospective clinical trial (14%), and proximity to critical structures to maximally spare organs at risk (66%). Forty patients were enrolled on 5 adult and 3 pediatric prospective clinical trials. The most common histologies treated were glioma (27%) and non-small cell lung cancer (18%) in adults, and medulloblastoma (22%) and low-grade glioma (24%) in pediatric patients. Prostate cancer composed 6% of PT. Complex cases composed 45% of our volume. Our photon patient volume increased yearly between 2011 and 2015, with 2780 patients completing photon treatment in 2011 and 3385 patients in 2015. PT composed 4% of overall patients treated with external beam radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The installation of our single-gantry proton facility has expanded the treatment options within our cancer center, helping to increase the number of patients we see. Patients travel from twice as far away to receive this treatment, many for typical PT indications such as pediatrics or to participate in prospective clinical trials.PMID: 27637136Title: Incidence and predictors of chest wall toxicity after high-dose radiation therapy in 15 fractions.Authors: Swanick CW, Allen PK, Tao R, Olanrewaju AM, Sutton JR, Lin SH, Welsh J, Das P, Chang JY, Crane CH, Gomez DRSource: Pract Radiat Oncol. 2016 Jun 3. pii: S1879-8500(16)30089-3. doi: 10.1016/j.prro.2016.05.009.Abstract: PURPOSE: Fifteen fraction treatment schedules are increasingly used to deliver high doses of radiation therapy (RT) to both lung and hepatobiliary malignancies. The purpose of our study was to examine the incidence and predictors of chest wall (CW) toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 135 patients treated with RT to doses >/=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions for thoracic and hepatobiliary malignancies between January 2009 and December 2012. We documented patient characteristics and CW dosimetric parameters for each case. Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, criteria for radiation dermatitis and CW pain. Patient characteristics and CW dosimetric parameters were evaluated for their association with CW toxicity using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9 months from the start of RT. Forty-eight patients (36%) developed dermatitis at a median time of 18 days. In multivariable analysis, the absolute volume of CW (in cm3) receiving 40 Gy (V40) >/=120 cm3 was associated with the occurrence of dermatitis (hazard ratio, 3.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-5.60; P < .001). Twenty-one patients (16%) developed CW pain (20 grade 1, 1 grade 2) at a median time of 3 months. In multivariable analysis, CW V40 >/=150 cm3 was associated with the occurrence of CW pain (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-6.24; P = .03). The absolute rate of CW pain in patients with V40 <150 cm3 was 11% versus 26% in patients with V40 >/=150 cm3 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated RT with 15 fraction regimens results in an acceptable incidence of CW toxicity, specifically CW pain. We recommend a dose constraint of V40 <150 cm3 to minimize this adverse event.PMID: 27637087Title: Comparison of outcomes of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in first- or second-line therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients with sensitive EGFR mutations.Authors: Xu J, Zhang X, Yang H, Ding G, Jin B, Lou Y, Zhang Y, Wang H, Han BSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12035.Abstract: Direct comparisons between the use of first- and second-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients with sensitive EGFR mutations are limited. A total of 264 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with sensitive mutations received EGFR TKI therapy as the first-line therapy, and a total of 187 patients received TKI as the second-line therapy at Shanghai Chest Hospital. First-line EGFR TKI therapy [12.9 months, 95% confidence interval (CI), 10.7-15.2] provided longer progression-free survival (PFS) than did second-line EGFR TKI therapy (9.0 months, 95% CI, 7.7-10.2) [hazard ratio (HR): 0.78, P = 0.034]. The objective response rate (ORR) of first-, and second-line TKI therapy were 67.8% (159/233) and 55.6% (94/169), respectively (P = 0.001). The overall survival (OS) for patients (n = 141) receiving first-line TKI followed by second-line chemotherapy were longer than those for patients (n = 187) receiving first-line chemotherapy followed by second-line TKI (HR: 0.69, P = 0.02).Compared with second-line TKI, first-line therapy achieved a significant and longer PFS, and higher ORR in the sensitive EGFR mutated NSCLC patients. The therapeutic strategy of using TKI followed by chemotherapy achieved longer OS than that using chemotherapy followed by TKI.PMID: 27637077Title: SIRT2 deletion enhances KRAS-induced tumorigenesis in vivo by regulating K147 acetylation status.Authors: Song HY, Biancucci M, Kang HJ, O'Callaghan C, Park SH, Principe DR, Jiang H, Yan Y, Satchell KF, Raparia K, Gius D, Vassilopoulos ASource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12015.Abstract: The observation that cellular transformation depends on breaching a crucial KRAS activity threshold, along with the finding that only a small percentage of cellsharboring KRAS mutations are transformed, support the idea that additional, not fully uncovered, regulatory mechanisms may contribute to KRAS activation. Here we report that KrasG12D mice lacking Sirt2 show an aggressive tumorigenic phenotype as compared to KrasG12D mice. This phenotype includes increased proliferation, KRAS acetylation, and activation of RAS downstream signaling markers. Mechanistically, KRAS K147 is identified as a novel SIRT2-specific deacetylation target by mass spectrometry, whereas its acetylation status directly regulates KRAS activity, ultimately exerting an impact on cellular behavior as revealed by cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth. Given the significance of KRAS activity as a driver in tumorigenesis, identification of K147 acetylation as a novel post-translational modification directed by SIRT2 in vivo may provide a better understanding of the mechanistic link regarding the crosstalk between non-genetic and genetic factors in KRAS driven tumors.PMID: 27637025Title: ALK Positive Lung Cancer: Clinical Profile, Practice and Outcomes in a Developing Country.Authors: Noronha V, Ramaswamy A, Patil VM, Joshi A, Chougule A, Kane S, Kumar R, Sahu A, Doshi V, Nayak L, Mahajan A, Janu A, Prabhash KSource: PLoS One. 2016 Sep 16;11(9):e0160752. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0160752. eCollection 2016.Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance and treatment profile of advanced EML4-ALK positive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in a developing country with potentially restricted access to Crizotinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of advanced ALK positive NSCLC patients who were treated from June 2012 to September 2015 was conducted. The primary goal was to evaluate outcomes of advanced ALK positive NSCLC in our practice and examine the logistic constraints in procuring Crizotinib. RESULTS: 94 patients were available for analysis. 21 (22.3%) patients were started on Crizotinib upfront, 60 (63.8%) on chemotherapy, 10 (10.6%) on Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (in view of poor PS) and 3 (3.2%) patients were offered best supportive care. Reasons for not starting Crizotinib upfront included symptomatic patients needing early initiation of therapy (23.3%), ALK not tested upfront (23.3%) and financial constraints (21.9%). 69 patients (73.4%) received Crizotinib at some stage during treatment. Dose interruptions (> 1 week) with Crizotinib were seen in 20 patients (29%), with drug toxicity being the commonest reason (85%). Median Progression free survival (PFS) on first line therapy for the entire cohort was 10 months, with a significant difference between patients receiving Crizotinib and those who did not ever receive Crizotinib (10 months vs. 2 months, p = 0.028). Median Overall Survival (OS) was not reached for the entire cohort, with 1 year survival being 81.2%. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of >2 had a significantly reduced PFS compared to patients with PS < = 2 (1.5 months vs. 11 months, p< 0.001). 47 patients with financial constraints (68.1%) received Crizotinib completely free via various extramural support schemes. CONCLUSION: A majority of our ALK positive NSCLC patients were exposed to Crizotinib through the help of various support mechanisms and these patients had similar outcomes to that reported from previously published literature.PMID: 27636991Title: Oxidized macrophage migration inhibitory factor is a potential new tissue marker and drug target in cancer.Authors: Schinagl A, Thiele M, Douillard P, Volkel D, Kenner L, Kazemi Z, Freissmuth M, Scheiflinger F, Kerschbaumer RJSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11970.Abstract: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, which was shown to be upregulated in cancers and to exhibit tumor promoting properties. Unlike other cytokines, MIF is ubiquitously present in the circulation and tissue of healthy subjects. We recently described a previously unrecognized, disease-related isoform of MIF, designated oxMIF, which is present in the circulation of patients with different inflammatory diseases. In this article, we report that oxMIF is also linked to different solid tumors as it is specifically expressed in tumor tissue from patients with colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer. Furthermore, oxMIF can be specifically targeted by a subset of phage display-derived fully human, monoclonal anti-MIF antibodies (mAbs) that were shown to neutralize pro-tumorigenic activities of MIF in vivo. We further demonstrate that anti-oxMIF mAbs sensitize human cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, A2780 and A2780ADR) to the action of cytotoxic drugs (mitoxantrone, cisplatin and doxorubicin) in vitro and in an A2780 xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. We conclude that oxMIF is the disease related isoform of MIF in solid tumors and a potential new diagnostic marker and drug target in cancer.PMID: 27636855Title: Development and application of a double- antibody sandwich ELISA kit for the detection of serum MUC1 in lung cancer patients.Authors: Wang J, Zhang S, Ni W, Zhai X, Xie F, Yuan H, Gao S, Tai GSource: Cancer Biomark. 2016 Sep 9.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mucin 1 (MUC1), as an oncogene, plays an important role in the diagnosis of lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: To establish a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kit for the detection of serum MUC1 in lung cancer patients. METHODS: Commercial mouse anti-human MUC1 monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-human MUC1 polyclonal antibody were used to construct a double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit. The serum MUC1 levels in peripheral blood of lung disease patients and healthy individuals were detected by the double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit and CA15-3 kit, respectively. RESULTS: A double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit was successfully constructed, and the sensitivity was up to 0.5 mu g/l. The cut-off value for the serum MUC1 levels in the peripheral blood was 1.98 mu g/l, the sensitivity was 62.5%, the specificity was 100% and the Youden index was 0.6250 when detected by the double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit, while the sensitivity was 18.75%, the specificity was 100% and the Youden index was 0.1875 when detected by CA15-3 kit. CONCLUSION: The double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit is superior to the CA15-3 kit in the detection of serum MUC1 in lung cancer patients, suggesting an attractive applying of the double-antibody sandwich ELISA kit in the early diagnosis of lung cancer.PMID: 27636353Title: Fusion proteins in head and neck neoplasms: Clinical implications, genetics, and future directions for targeting.Authors: Escalante DA, Wang H, Fundakowski CESource: Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Aug 15:1-8.Abstract: Fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements are known to drive the pathogenesis of a variety of hematological and solid neoplasms such as chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small-cell lung cancer. Efforts to elucidate the role they play in these malignancies have led to important diagnostic and therapeutic triumphs, including the famous development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib targeting the BCR-ABL fusion. Until recently, there has been a paucity of research investigating fusion proteins harbored by head and neck neoplasms. The discovery and characterization of novel fusion proteins in neoplasms originating from the thyroid, nasopharynx, salivary glands, and midline head and neck structures offer substantial contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis and biological behavior of these neoplasms, while raising new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities. Further characterization of these fusion proteins promises to facilitate advances on par with those already achieved with regard to hematologic malignancies in the precise, molecularly guided diagnosis and treatment of head and neck neoplasms. The following is a subsite specific review of the clinical implications of fusion proteins in head and neck neoplasms and the future potential for diagnostic targeting.PMID: 27636102Title: Cytology smears as excellent starting material for next-generation sequencing-based molecular testing of patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung.Authors: Velizheva NP, Rechsteiner MP, Wong CE, Zhong Q, Rossle M, Bode B, Moch H, Soltermann A, Wild PJ, Tischler VSource: Cancer Cytopathol. 2016 Sep 16. doi: 10.1002/cncy.21771.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Molecular testing of lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs) is crucial for therapy stratification of patients. Because of the often limited diagnostic material, the authors aimed to explore the suitability of cytology smears for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared the results with concurrent histological specimens or cell blocks. METHODS: A total of 16 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ADCs with known genetic alterations were used as the first cohort for targeted DNA and RNA sequencing. In the second cohort of 8 cases, 8 cytological smears were compared with matching histological specimens or cell blocks for the study. For NGS library amplification, commercially available panels for DNA and RNA sequencing were applied. The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and the Ion Reporter workflow (version 5.0) were used for sequencing. RESULTS: All DNA libraries derived from FFPE and non-formalin-fixed cytological smear samples produced acceptable quality metrics, thereby enabling successful targeted DNA sequencing (100% performance). Targeted RNA sequencing failed in 1 FFPE case and 1 cytology probe by not reaching enough mapped fusion reads (92% performance rate). All previously detected mutations and gene rearrangements could be confirmed (sensitivity of 100%), whereas specificity of the DNA-based NGS assay reached 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated the suitability of non-formalin cytology specimens for the simultaneous NGS testing of lung ADCs using amplicon resequencing panels. These assays allowed for the input of cytological smears equal to concurrent histology or cell blocks and proved to be accurate in the detection of therapeutically actionable somatic mutations and gene rearrangements.

G1 and G2 are named neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) whereas G3 neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). While advanced G1 and G2 are usually treated with several different therapies, including somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, interferon, molecular targeted agents, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and liver-directed treatments, advanced G3 NECs are usually treated with a platinum-etoposide chemotherapy, trusting their clinical homogeneity is similar to that of small cell lung cancer. However, over the last years a number of reports suggested that 2010 WHO G3 GEP NECs are more heterogeneous than expected. Therefore, we critically reviewed the literature about this topic and reported pathological and clinical considerations on 2010 WHO G3 GEP NEC category proposing new sub-categories. Over the last five years, six studies specifically investigating large series of G3 GEP NECs have been published, including around 800 patients. Tumor morphology and Ki-67 Labeling Index (that will be mentioned as Ki-67 in this manuscript) combination has been reported as a tool to define two or even three subgroups of this category with different prognosis and potentially different therapeutic approach. Prospective trials are warranted to investigate if several types of therapy other than the platinum/etoposide chemotherapy can be effective in well differentiated GEP NEN with 21-55% Ki-67 and alkylating-based chemotherapy in poorly differentiated GEP NEN with 21-55% Ki-67.PMID: 27635765Title: Practical multimodal care for cancer cachexia.Authors: Maddocks M, Hopkinson J, Conibear J, Reeves A, Shaw C, Fearon KCSource: Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2016 Sep 15.Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer cachexia is common and reduces function, treatment tolerability and quality of life. Given its multifaceted pathophysiology a multimodal approach to cachexia management is advocated for, but can be difficult to realise in practice. We use a case-based approach to highlight practical approaches to the multimodal management of cachexia for patients across the cancer trajectory. RECENT FINDINGS: Four cases with lung cancer spanning surgical resection, radical chemoradiotherapy, palliative chemotherapy and no anticancer treatment are presented. We propose multimodal care approaches that incorporate nutritional support, exercise, and anti-inflammatory agents, on a background of personalized oncology care and family-centred education. Collectively, the cases reveal that multimodal care is part of everyone's remit, often focuses on supported self-management, and demands buy-in from the patient and their family. Once operationalized, multimodal care approaches can be tested pragmatically, including alongside emerging pharmacological cachexia treatments. SUMMARY: We demonstrate that multimodal care for cancer cachexia can be achieved using simple treatments and without a dedicated team of specialists. The sharing of advice between health professionals can help build collective confidence and expertise, moving towards a position in which every team member feels they can contribute towards multimodal care.PMID: 27635639Title: Clinicopathological Characteristics and Survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in Non-Adenocarcinoma Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.Authors: Song Z, Yu X, Zhang YSource: Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Sep 16:0.Abstract: BACKGROUND: ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements represent three most frequent fusion genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Rearrangements of these three genes exist predominantly in lung adenocarcinoma while rarely in non-adenocarcinoma. Our objective was to explore the frequency, clinicopathological characteristics and survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. METHODS: ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements were screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with completely resected non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. All positive samples were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients underwent complete resection, including squamous cell carcinoma (n = 245), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 85) and large cell carcinoma (n = 55). Twelve of them were identified as harboring fusion genes, including ALK (n = 7), ROS1 (n = 3) and RET (n = 2) rearrangements. The fusion frequencies of adenosquamous, squamous cell and large cell carcinomas were 8.2%, 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. Their median age was 49.5 years and 3 of them had a smoking history. No survival difference existed between fusion gene positive and negative patients (36.7 vs.50.2 months, P = 0.21). CONCLUSION: The frequencies of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are low in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. And their clinical characteristics are similar to those in lung adenocarcinoma. Fusions of the above three genes are not prognostic factor for non-adnocarcinoma NSCLC patients.PMID: 27635524Title: Inflammatory Events and Oxidant Production in the Diaphragm, Gastrocnemius, and Blood of Rats Exposed to Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia: Therapeutic Strategies.Authors: Dominguez-Alvarez M, Gea J, Barreiro ESource: J Cell Physiol. 2016 Sep 16. doi: 10.1002/jcp.25600.Abstract: We hypothesized that inflammatory events and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may be differentially expressed in respiratory and limb muscles, and blood of a chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) experimental model and that antioxidants and TNF-alpha blockade may influence those events. In blood, diaphragm, and gastrocnemius of rats non-invasively exposed to CIH (10% hypoxia, two hours/day, 14 consecutive days) with/without concomitant treatment with either anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), inflammatory cytokines, superoxide anion production, muscle structural abnormalities, and fiber-type composition were assessed. Compared to non-exposed controls, in CIH-exposed rats, body weight gain was reduced, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and interferon-gamma levels were increased in diaphragm, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta plasma levels were greater, systemic and muscle superoxide anion production was higher, diaphragm and gastrocnemius inflammatory cells and internal nuclei were higher, and muscle fiber-type and morphometry remained unmodified. CIH rats treated with infliximab further increased TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and interferon-gamma diaphragm levels, whereas NAC induced a reduction only in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in diaphragm and plasma. Infliximab and NAC elicited a significant decline in superoxide anion production in diaphragm, gastrocnemius, and plasma, while inducing a further increase in inflammatory cells and internal nuclei in both muscles. Proinflammatory cytokines are differentially expressed in respiratory and limb muscles and plasma of CIH-exposed rats, while superoxide anion production increased in both muscle types and blood. Infliximab and NAC exerted different effects. These findings may help understand the biology underlying CIH in skeletal muscles and blood of patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

However, how BJO exerts this antitumor effect is still largely unknown. Here, effects of BJO on the growth of NSCLC and SCLC cell lines were investigated by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenytetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay, and the results showed that BJO inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells (NSCLC) and H446 cells (SCLC). Further studies revealed that BJO induced G0/G1 arrest partly via regulating p53 and cyclin D1 in these two cell lines. BJO also has pro-apoptotic effect on H446 and A549 cells through mitochondria/caspase-mediated pathway, which was initiated by the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). These findings thus revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of BJO on SCLC and NSCLC, which may benefit the further clinical application of BJO.PMID: 27635400Title: Candidate SNP Markers of Chronopathologies Are Predicted by a Significant Change in the Affinity of TATA-Binding Protein for Human Gene Promoters.Authors: Ponomarenko P, Rasskazov D, Suslov V, Sharypova E, Savinkova L, Podkolodnaya O, Podkolodny NL, Tverdokhleb NN, Chadaeva I, Ponomarenko M, Kolchanov NSource: Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:8642703. doi: 10.1155/2016/8642703. Epub 2016 Aug 22.Abstract: Variations in human genome (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) may be associated with hereditary diseases, their complications, comorbidities, and drug responses. Using Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator presented in our previous paper, here we analyzed immediate surroundings of known SNP markers of diseases and identified several candidate SNP markers that can significantly change the affinity of TATA-binding protein for human gene promoters, with circadian consequences. For example, rs572527200 may be related to asthma, where symptoms are circadian (worse at night), and rs367732974 may be associated with heart attacks that are characterized by a circadian preference (early morning). By the same method, we analyzed the 90 bp proximal promoter region of each protein-coding transcript of each human gene of the circadian clock core. This analysis yielded 53 candidate SNP markers, such as rs181985043 (susceptibility to acute Q fever in male patients), rs192518038 (higher risk of a heart attack in patients with diabetes), and rs374778785 (emphysema and lung cancer in smokers). If they are properly validated according to clinical standards, these candidate SNP markers may turn out to be useful for physicians (to select optimal treatment for each patient) and for the general population (to choose a lifestyle preventing possible circadian complications of diseases).PMID: 27635269Title: SIADH Induced by Pharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Case Report and Literature Review.Authors: Arshad HM, Rodriguez A, Suhail FSource: Case Rep Nephrol. 2016;2016:3186714. doi: 10.1155/2016/3186714. Epub 2016 Aug 22.Abstract: Background. The Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) is considered to be the most common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. The most common malignancy associated with SIADH is small cell lung cancer. We present a rare case of a patient with SIADH secondary to well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the naso-oropharynx. Case. A 46-year-old Caucasian woman presented to emergency department with four-week history of progressive dysphagia. On examination, she was found to have a pharyngeal mass. CT scan and MRI of neck confirmed a mass highly suspicious of carcinoma. Patient's serum sodium level decreased to 118 mEq/L and other labs including serum and urine osmolality confirmed SIADH. She was started on fluid restriction and oral sodium tablets which gradually improved her serum sodium levels. Biopsy confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of pharynx. Conclusion. SIADH can be caused by squamous cell carcinoma. Appropriate management includes fluid restriction.PMID: 27635139Title: Study of the Effects of Betaine and/or C-Phycocyanin on the Growth of Lung Cancer A549 Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.Authors: Bingula R, Dupuis C, Pichon C, Berthon JY, Filaire M, Pigeon L, Filaire ESource: J Oncol. 2016;2016:8162952. doi: 10.1155/2016/8162952. Epub 2016 Aug 22.Abstract: We investigated the effects of betaine, C-phycocyanin (C-PC), and their combined use on the growth of A549 lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo. When cells were coincubated with betaine and C-PC, an up to 60% decrease in viability was observed which is significant compared to betaine (50%) or C-PC treatment alone (no decrease). Combined treatment reduced the stimulation of NF-kappaB expression by TNF-alpha and increased the amount of the proapoptotic p38 MAPK. Interestingly, combined treatment induced a cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase for ~60% of cells. In vivo studies were performed in pathogen-free male nude rats injected with A549 cells in their right flank. Their daily food was supplemented with either betaine, C-PC, both, or neither. Compared to the control group, tumour weights and volumes were significantly reduced in either betaine- or C-PC-treated groups and no additional decrease was obtained with the combined treatment. This data indicates that C-PC and betaine alone may efficiently inhibit tumour growth in rats. The synergistic activity of betaine and C-PC on A549 cells growth observed in vitro remains to be further confirmed in vivo. The reason behind the nature of their interaction is yet to be sought.PMID: 27635065Title: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial Pathology Tissue Resource.Authors: Zhu CS, Huang WY, Pinsky PF, Berg CD, Sherman M, Yu KJ, Carrick DM, Black A, Hoover R, Lenz P, Williams C, Hawkins L, Chaloux M, Yurgalevitch S, Mathew S, Miller A, Olivo V, Khan A, Pretzel SM, Multerer D, Beckmann P, Broski KG, Freedman NDSource: Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2016 Sep 15. pii: cebp.0506.2016.Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pathology tissue specimens with associated epidemiological and clinical data are valuable for cancer research. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial undertook a large-scale effort to create a public resource of pathology tissues from PLCO participants who developed a cancer during the trial. METHODS: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were obtained from pathology laboratories on a loan basis for central processing of tissue microarrays, with additional free-standing tissue cores collected for nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: Pathology tissue specimens have been obtained for prostate cancer (n=1,052), lung cancer (n=434), colorectal cancer (n=673) and adenoma (n=658), ovarian cancer and borderline tumors (n=212), breast cancer (n=870) and bladder cancer (n=201). The process of creating this resource was complex, involving multi-disciplinary teams with expertise in pathology, epidemiology, information technology, project management and specialized laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: Creating the PLCO tissue resource required a multi-step process including obtaining medical records and contacting pathology departments where pathology materials were stored after obtaining necessary patient consent and authorization. The potential to link tissue biomarkers to prospectively collected epidemiological information, screening and clinical data, and matched blood or buccal samples offers valuable opportunities to study etiologic heterogeneity, mechanisms of carcinogenesis and biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. IMPACT: The methods and protocols developed for this effort, and the detailed description of this resource provided here will be useful for those seeking to use PLCO pathology tissue specimens for their research and may also inform future tissue collection efforts in other settings.PMID: 27634898Title: Differential expression analysis for individual cancer samples based on robust within-sample relative gene expression orderings across multiple profiling platforms.Authors: Guan Q, Chen R, Yan H, Cai H, Guo Y, Li M, Li X, Tong M, Ao L, Li H, Hong G, Guo ZSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11996.Abstract: The highly stable within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs in a particular type of human normal tissue are widely reversed in the cancer condition. Based on this finding, we have recently proposed an algorithm named RankComp to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for individual disease samples measured by a particular platform. In this paper, with 461 normal lung tissue samples separately measured by four commonly used platforms, we demonstrated that tens of millions of gene pairs with significantly stable REOs in normal lung tissue can be consistently detected in samples measured by different platforms. However, about 20% of stable REOs commonly detected by two different platforms (e.g., Affymetrix and Illumina platforms) showed inconsistent REO patterns due to the differences in probe design principles. Based on the significantly stable REOs (FDR<0.01) for normal lung tissue consistently detected by the four platforms, which tended to have large rank differences, RankComp detected averagely 1184, 1335 and 1116 DEGs per sample with averagely 96.51%, 95.95% and 94.78% precisions in three evaluation datasets with 25, 57 and 58 paired lung cancer and normal samples, respectively. Individualized pathway analysis revealed some common and subtype-specific functional mechanisms of lung cancer. Similar results were observed for colorectal cancer. In conclusion, based on the cross-platform significantly stable REOs for a particular normal tissue, differentially expressed genes and pathways in any disease sample measured by any of the platforms can be readily and accurately detected, which could be further exploited for dissecting the heterogeneity of cancer.PMID: 27634890Title: Epigenetic therapy potential of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid on invasive human non-small cell lung cancer cells.Authors: Zhang S, Wu K, Feng J, Wu Z, Deng Q, Guo C, Xia B, Zhang J, Huang H, Zhu L, Zhang K, Shen B, Chen X, Ma SSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11967.Abstract: Metastasis is the reason for most cancer death, and a crucial primary step for cancer metastasis is invasion of the surrounding tissue, which may be initiated by some rare tumor cells that escape the heterogeneous primary tumor. In this study, we isolated invasive subpopulations of cancer cells from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H460 and H1299 cell lines, and determined the gene expression profiles and the responses of these invasive cancer cells to treatments of ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. The subpopulation of highly invasive NSCLC cells showed epigenetic signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cell stemness, increased DNA damage repair and cell survival signaling. We also investigated the epigenetic therapy potential of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on invasive cancer cells, and found that SAHA suppresses cancer cell invasiveness and sensitizes cancer cells to treatments of IR and chemotherapeutic agents. Our results provide guidelines for identification of metastatic predictors and for clinical management of NSCLC. This study also suggests a beneficial clinical potential of SAHA as a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC patients.PMID: 27634875Title: FOXC2 augments tumor propagation and metastasis in osteosarcoma.Authors: Gozo MC, Jia D, Aspuria PJ, Cheon DJ, Miura N, Walts AE, Karlan BY, Orsulic SSource: Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11990.Abstract: Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor that contains a small subpopulation of tumor-propagating cells (also known as tumor-initiating cells) characterized by drug resistance and high metastatic potential. The molecular mechanism by which tumor-propagating cells promote tumor growth is poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) is frequently expressed in human osteosarcomas and is important in maintaining osteosarcoma cells in a stem-like state. In osteosarcoma cell lines, we show that anoikis conditions stimulate FOXC2 expression. Downregulation of FOXC2 decreases anchorage-independent growth and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo, while overexpression of FOXC2 increases tumor propagation in vivo. In osteosarcoma cell lines, we demonstrate that high levels of FOXC2 are associated with and required for the expression of osteosarcoma tumor-propagating cell markers. In FOXC2 knockdown cell lines, we show that CXCR4, a downstream target of FOXC2, can restore osteosarcoma cell invasiveness and metastasis to the lung.PMID: 27634761Title: Molecular evolution patterns in metastatic lymph nodes reflect the differential treatment response of advanced primary lung cancer.Authors: Um SW, Joung JG, Lee H, Kim H, Kim KT, Park J, Hayes DN, Park WYSource: Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 13. pii: canres.0873.2016.Abstract: Tumor heterogeneity influences the clinical outcome of cancer patients, and the diagnostic method to measure the tumor heterogeneity needs to be developed. We analyzed genomic features on pairs of primary and multiple metastatic lymph nodes from six lung cancer patients using whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq. Although somatic single nucleotide variants were shared in primary lung cancer and metastases, tumor evolution predicted by the pattern of genomic alterations was matched to anatomical location of the tumors. Four out of six cases exhibited a branched clonal evolution pattern. Lymph nodes with acquired somatic variants demonstrated resistance to the cancer treatment. In this study, we demonstrated that multiple biopsies and sequencing strategies for different tumor regions are required for a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of genetic alteration and for guiding targeted therapy in advanced primary lung cancer.PMID: 27634639Title: The roles of miRNAs as potential biomarkers in lung diseases.Authors: Alipoor SD, Adcock IM, Garssen J, Mortaz E, Varahram M, Mirsaeidi M, Velayati ASource: Eur J Pharmacol. 2016 Sep 12. pii: S0014-2999(16)30583-0. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.09.015.Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which can act as master regulators of gene expression, modulate almost all biological process and are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been associated with aberrant gene expression and may lead to pathological conditions. Evidence suggests that miRNA expression profiles are altered between health and disease and as such may be considered as biomarkers of disease. Evidence is increasing that miRNAs are particularly important in lung homeostasis and development and have been demonstrated to be the involved in many pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, sarcoidosis, lung cancer and other smoking related diseases. Better understanding of the function of miRNA and the mechanisms underlying their action in the lung, would help to improve current diagnosis and therapeutics strategies in pulmonary diseases. Recently, some miRNA-based drugs have been introduced as possible therapeutic agents. In this review we aim to summarize the recent findings regarding the role of miRNAs in the airways and lung and emphasise their potential therapeutic roles in pulmonary diseases.PMID: 27634496Title: Emerging and established clinical, histopathological and molecular parametric prognostic factors for metastatic spine disease secondary to lung cancer: Helping surgeons make decisions.Authors: Batista N, Tee J, Sciubba D, Sahgal A, Laufer I, Weber M, Gokaslan Z, Rhines L, Fehlings M, Patel S, Raja Rampersaud Y, Reynolds J, Chou D, Bettegowda C, Clarke M, Fisher CSource: J Clin Neurosci. 2016 Sep 12. pii: S0967-5868(16)30394-0. doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2016.05.023.Abstract: Metastatic lung cancer to the spine occurs at high rates with patients usually given poor prognoses. Recent studies have observed that patients with certain genetic and molecular aberrations have better responses to adjuvant therapy. As such, current metastatic spine disease treatment algorithms grading all lung primaries' prognosis as poor may lead to inadequate treatment of spinal metastases. The aims of this study are to determine current survival patterns in metastatic spine disease secondary to lung cancer and identify relevant parameters that influence the prognostication of these patients. A systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was conducted for literature published between January 1, 1996 and September 31, 2015. The 27 studies identified were Level IV retrospective studies with an overall 'low' level of evidence. The overall median survival of patients with spine involved metastatic lung cancer was poor, ranging from 3.6 to 9months. Median survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer being treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were observed to be better, with survival of up to 18months. This review reports a subset of lung cancer patients with oncogenic molecular mutations that appear to confer a better overall survival. In these patients, individualized assessment rather than strict adherence to current metastatic scoring algorithms when determining management may be preferred.PMID: 27634346Title: MicroRNA187 is an independent prognostic factor in lung cancer and promotes lung cancer cell invasion via targeting of PTRF.Authors: Peng J, Liu HZ, Zhong J, Deng ZF, Tie CR, Rao Q, Xu W, You T, Li J, Cai CB, Lu Q, Liu W, Zhang Y, Lei ZYSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5083.Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the progression of different types of cancers giving new hope for cancer treatment. The role and regulatory mechanism of microRNA187 (miR187) are largely unknown. In the present study, 74 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were selected. Tumor tissues and matched normal tissues were collected for determining the expression level of miR187. Cell research was performed to detect the function of miR187. The expression level was measured and miR187 was found to be overexpressed in the NSCLC cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR187 promoted cell proliferation in the A549 and H1650 cell lines. Moreover, overexpression of miR187 also promoted cell migration and invasion. Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) was identified as a target of miR187. Overexpression of miR187 suppressed the expression of PTRF. Knockdown of PTRF promoted lung cancer cell invasion, and overexpression of PTRF had a negative effect on lung cancer cell invasion. The PTRF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in their adjacent normal lung tissues as determined by realtime PCR (RTPCR). The expression of the PTRF protein was significantly weaker than that in the adjacent normal lung tissues using immunohistochemical staining. The findings revealed that miR187 promotes cell growth and invasion by targeting PTRF and miR187 may be a new prognostic factor for NSCLC.PMID: 27634334Title: DNA replication stress mediates APOBEC3 family mutagenesis in breast cancer.Authors: Kanu N, Cerone MA, Goh G, Zalmas LP, Bartkova J, Dietzen M, McGranahan N, Rogers R, Law EK, Gromova I, Kschischo M, Walton MI, Rossanese OW, Bartek J, Harris RS, Venkatesan S, Swanton CSource: Genome Biol. 2016 Sep 15;17(1):185. doi: 10.1186/s13059-016-1042-9.Abstract: BACKGROUND: The APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases mutate the cancer genome in a range of cancer types. Although many studies have documented the downstream effects of APOBEC3 activity through next-generation sequencing, less is known about their upstream regulation. In this study, we sought to identify a molecular basis for APOBEC3 expression and activation. RESULTS: HER2 amplification and PTEN loss promote DNA replication stress and APOBEC3B activity in vitro and correlate with APOBEC3 mutagenesis in vivo. HER2-enriched breast carcinomas display evidence of elevated levels of replication stress-associated DNA damage in vivo. Chemical and cytotoxic induction of replication stress, through aphidicolin, gemcitabine, camptothecin or hydroxyurea exposure, activates transcription of APOBEC3B via an ATR/Chk1-dependent pathway in vitro. APOBEC3B activation can be attenuated through repression of oncogenic signalling, small molecule inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and alleviation of replication stress through nucleoside supplementation. CONCLUSION: These data link oncogene, loss of tumour suppressor gene and drug-induced replication stress with APOBEC3B activity, providing new insights into how cytidine deaminase-induced mutagenesis might be activated in tumourigenesis and limited therapeutically.PMID: 27634022Title: Effect of metastasis suppressor 1 on H1299 cells and its clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer.Authors: Zhao H, Xue J, Liu J, Liu Y, Cheng YSource: Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep 12. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5081.Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of human H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells and its clinical significance in nonsmall cell lung cancer. The target gene MTSS1-overexpressing lentivirus (LV-MTSS1) was transfected into H1299 cells and expression of MTSS1 was detected at the mRNA and protein levels. Cell Counting Kit-8, wound healing and Transwell assays revealed that the migration and invasion activities were significantly suppressed by MTSS1, but that it had no effect on cell proliferation. In addition, MTSS1 expression in tissue microarrays including samples from 223 cases of non-small cell lung cancer was tested by immunohistochemistry to explore the correlation between MTSS1 and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. MTSS1 suppressed H1299 cell migration and invasion, and its expression level can be used as a new independent factor for determining the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer.PMID: 27634019Title: National Institutes of Health Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Late Effects Initiative: Consensus Recommendations for Subsequent Neoplasms.Authors: Morton LM, Saber W, Baker KS, Barrett AJ, Bhatia S, Engels EA, Gadalla SM, Kleiner DE, Pavletic S, Burns LJSource: Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2016 Sep 12. pii: S1083-8791(16)30331-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2016.09.005.Abstract: Subsequent neoplasms (SN) following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) cause significant patient morbidity and mortality. Risks for specific SN types vary substantially, with particularly elevated risks for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, and squamous cell malignancies. This consensus document provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding SN after HCT and recommends priorities and approaches to overcome challenges and gaps in understanding. Numerous factors have been suggested to impact risk, including patient-related (e.g., age), primary disease-related (e.g., disease type, pre-HCT therapies), and HCT-related characteristics (e.g., type and intensity of conditioning regimen, stem cell source, development of graft-versus-host disease). However, gaps in understanding remain for each of these risk factors, particularly for patients receiving HCT in the current era due to substantial advances in clinical transplantation practices. Additionally, the influence of non-transplant-related risk factors (e.g., germline genetic susceptibility, oncogenic viruses, lifestyle factors) is poorly understood. Clarification of the magnitude of SN risks and identification of etiologic factors will require large-scale, long-term, systematic follow-up of HCT survivors with detailed clinical data. Most investigations of the mechanisms of SN pathogenesis after HCT have focused on immune drivers. Expansion of our understanding in this area will require interdisciplinary laboratory collaborations utilizing measures of immune function and availability of archival tissue from SN diagnoses. Consensus-based recommendations for optimal preventative, screening, and therapeutic approaches have been developed for certain SN after HCT, whereas for other SN, general population guidelines are recommended. Further evidence is needed to specifically tailor preventative, screening, and therapeutic guidelines for SN after HCT, particularly for unique patient populations. Accomplishment of this broad research agenda will require increased investment in systematic data collection with engagement from patients, clinicians, and interdisciplinary scientists in order to reduce the burden of SN in the rapidly growing population of HCT survivors.
